11585/956123,A New Generation of Hydrogen-Fueled Hybrid Propulsion Systems for the Urban Mobility of the Future,"The H2-ICE project aims at developing, through numerical simulation, a new generation of hybrid powertrains featuring a hydrogen-fueled Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) suitable for 12 m urban buses in order to provide a reliable and cost-effective solution for the abatement of both CO2 and criteria pollutant emissions. The full exploitation of the potential of such a traction system requires a substantial enhancement of the state of the art since several issues have to be addressed. In particular, the choice of a more suitable fuel injection system and the control of the combustion process are extremely challenging. Firstly, a high-fidelity 3D-CFD model will be exploited to analyze the in-cylinder H2 fuel injection through supersonic flows. Then, after the optimization of the injection and combustion process, a 1D model of the whole engine system will be built and calibrated, allowing the identification of a “sweet spot” in the ultra-lean combustion region, characterized by extremely low NOx emissions and, at the same time, high combustion efficiencies. Moreover, to further enhance the engine efficiency well above 40%, different Waste Heat Recovery (WHR) systems will be carefully scrutinized, including both Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC)-based recovery units as well as electric turbo-compounding. A Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) aftertreatment system will be developed to further reduce NOx emissions to near-zero levels. Finally, a dedicated torque-based control strategy for the ICE coupled with the Energy Management Systems (EMSs) of the hybrid powertrain, both optimized by exploiting Vehicle-To-Everything (V2X) connection, allows targeting H2 consumption of 0.1 kg/km. Technologies developed in the H2-ICE project will enhance the know-how necessary to design and build engines and aftertreatment systems for the efficient exploitation of H2 as a fuel, as well as for their integration into hybrid powertrains.",hydrogen; H2-ICE; decarbonization; public transport,0.00521325925,0.00307626603,0.00701169949,0.00438387739,0.0012816051,0.00930749,0.0533224121,0.0207468383,0.0385471955,0.00363320136,0.563133,0.0938240886,0.17747663,0.00566589506,0.0106742624,0.00270225573,
11585/911288,A Review of User Vulnerabilities Associated with Shared Sanitation Practices in Sub-Saharan Africa,"Aims: Shared sanitation was excluded from the basic service level due to perceived limitations of their hygiene, accessibility and safety. But how does the current body of scientific knowledge influence the narrative? This paper is aimed at reviewing data on the current status and vulnerability issues reported to be associated with shared sanitation in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Methodology: Literature was searched using key search terms from nine databases. Peerreviewed articles and various reports of individual country studies published in English from January 2000 to April 2022 were selected. Results: As at 2020, the proportion of the population sharing sanitation facilities in SSA was estimated as 19% compared to 7% globally. The review revealed a mixed opinion about issues and vulnerabilities associated with shared sanitation which may have arisen from inconsistencies in the typologies and levels of sharing of facilities among the reviewed studies. Using shared sanitation was found to be associated with an increased risk of diarrheal diseases (OR=1.06; 95%CI: 1.03- 1.08) and non-partner violence against women (OR=1.52; 95%CI: 1.22-1.82). However, there is also evidence that many shared facilities, particularly those shared by a few (2-3) households, are clean, meet the needs of the users and afford them similar health outcomes as non-shared facilities. Conclusion: The findings of the review suggest that the outright exclusion of all forms of shared sanitation from basic sanitation potentially underestimates the global efforts and progress toward access to sanitation. There is a need to segregate communal and public toilets from privately shared facilities in future research as well as the progress reporting by the Joint Monitoring Programme (JMP). It is also recommended that steps are taken by the JMP to develop indicators for identifying and incorporating quality shared sanitation facilities into the basic sanitation service level in order to give a more realistic account of the global effort towards sanitation access.",Shared sanitation; WASH; Sub-Saharan Africa; health outcome; user vulnerability,0.0493049,0.0181577243,0.0403821133,0.0144013157,0.352221668,0.0521475412,0.00317592197,0.0157788862,0.00551156374,0.0270064529,0.00672813132,0.00856536627,0.00217110128,0.00421742,0.00604342856,0.394186467,
11585/966816,A Systematic Analysis of Security Metrics for Industrial Cyber–Physical Systems,"Nowadays, as the cyber-threat landscape is evolving and digital assets are proliferating and becoming more and more interconnected with the internet and heterogeneous devices, it is fundamental to be able to obtain a sensible measure of the security of devices, networks, and systems. Industrial cyber–physical systems (ICPSs), in particular, can be exposed to high operational risks that entail damage to revenues, assets, and even people. A way to overcome the open question of measuring security is with the use of security metrics. With metrics it is possible to rely on proven indicators that benchmark systems, identify vulnerabilities, and show practical data to assess the risk. However, security metrics are often proposed with specific contexts in mind, and a set of them specifically crafted for ICPSs is not explicitly available in the literature. For this reason, in this work, we analyze the current state of the art in the selection of security metrics and we propose a systematic methodology to gather, filter, and validate security metrics. Then, we apply the procedure to the ICPS domain, gathering almost 300 metrics from the literature, analyzing the domain to identify the properties useful to filter the metrics, and applying a validation framework to assess the validity of the filtered metrics, obtaining a final set capable of measuring the security of ICPSs from different perspectives.",cyber–physical systems;cybersecurity;industrial cyber–physical systems;industrial networks;security metrics,0.0141225941,0.00210986356,0.00732343644,0.00524470629,0.0022980778,0.00388531946,0.0390075482,0.0484497808,0.747104108,0.0299657322,0.0167102646,0.0360154137,0.00351274922,0.00609396165,0.00813679863,0.0300196297,
11585/960888,A methodological framework for flood hazard assessment for land transport infrastructures,"The complexity of land transport infrastructures, their length and the heterogeneity of potential hazardous scenarios across large areas make flood hazard assessment a challenging task. We propose a parsimonious, rapid and operational procedure that enables large scale applications and, at the same time, a detailed evaluation of individual segments of linear transport infrastructures. In particular, we focus on extensive land transport infrastructure networks (i.e., railways) and propose a methodological framework for: (1) identifying segments of the network that are prone to fluvial flooding, and (2) grouping the identified elements into different hazard classes depending on the mechanism and severity of the expected flooding scenario (i.e., damage due to potential embankment overtopping, embankment instability due to infiltration, erosion or washout, train or vehicles collision against fluvial deposits or debris, etc.). Network sections at risk, as well as main hazardous flood indices (e.g., water depth), are estimated referring to official inundation maps, when available, or by means of Digital Elevation Model (DEM)-based algorithms and geomorphic indices (e.g., Geomorphic Flood Index-GFI). In addition, a DEM-based approach is proposed to identify potential debris flow sources threatening the infrastructure. The procedure has been developed and tested for the Italian Railway Network (focusing on seven river basins), but it can be adapted to different cases and different land transport infrastructures. A first comparison with historical flood events proves the potential of the procedure, which can support stakeholders in planning measures for managing and mitigating the flood risk associated with the transport networks across large spatial scales.",Transport infrastructures; Railway systems; Flood hazard; Debris-flow; DEM-Based approach; Geomorphic flood index,0.0308943093,0.0046545458,0.0084122736,0.00278848154,0.0012650732,0.104539521,0.00454002712,0.0193391535,0.0259876,0.0105007021,0.725465596,0.0129430266,0.00630562054,0.011259282,0.0203790031,0.0107258176,
11585/897011,A resources ecosystem for digital and heritage-led holistic knowledge in rural regeneration,"This paper presents a digital resources ecosystem prototype of integrated tools and resources to support heritage-led regeneration of rural regions, thanks to a deeper understanding of the complexity of cultural natural landscapes throughout their historical and current development. The ecosystem is conceived as a distributed software platform establishing data ecosystem and open standards for the management of information, aimed at providing different services and applications to address the needs of the various end-users identified. The platform has been conceived and realised in the framework of a Horizon 2020 research project, with a view to building a set of holistic knowledge about rural regions and their cultural and natural heritage and making it available for long-lasting heritage-led territorial processes of change. It is the product of a multidisciplinary collaboration amongst heritage, digital humanities and ICTs ex-perts, and combines data and methodologies from a range of approaches to humanities together with the customisation of effective digital tools. It has been designed for deployment also in cloud systems compli-ant with the Infrastructure-as-a-Service paradigm. All data is Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable (FAIR data). It hosts and integrates different tools, making the data gathered with/for local stakeholders usable and making the same data re-usable within the tools' functions, generating integrated heritage knowledge. It comprises data on 19 rural pilot territories, where the tools and their integration have been developed and tested, while 62 more are partially included as additional territories which partici-pate in certain activities within the project. The main testers for this platform and its functions are the local stakeholders of these territories. The paper describes and analyses the platform and its impact, dis-cussing the integration of tools as an innovative approach that goes beyond the use of individual tools in shaping a multidimensional vision. It also offers an analysis of the potential of an integrated digital ecosystem in evidence-based and place-based regeneration strategies.

11585/794673,A spatial decision support system for optimally locating treatment plants for safe wastewater reuse: An application to Saudi Arabia,"In this study, we developed a non-linear optimizing spatial decision support system that combines multi-criteria analysis with a geographical information system. We consider dedicated tertiary treatment for agricultural, industrial, and landscape uses by evaluating economic, social, and environmental objectives based on distances from opportunity costs and water quality standards. Saudi Arabia is used to illustrate decisions. Numerical simulations revealed that the budgeted number of plants is completely used, although tertiary treatment for all uses is seldom supported. Agricultural reuse is almost always suggested, whereas reuse in the industrial sector is not always suggested in provinces with current or planned industrial districts. Landscape reuse is always coupled with agricultural uses. The optimal wastewater treatment plants’ location significantly improves welfare, although to a different extent for different sectors. The system achieves a satisfactory sectoral equity, in terms of the ability to meet the needs of, and reduce the impacts for industrial, agricultural, and landscape sectors except for social features in small cities. Sensitivity analyses revealed that the best location is robust with respect to the relative weights of economic, social and environmental features and the predicted future treatment efficiencies, but not robust with respect to water quality standards.",Decision support system; Geographical information system; Multi-criteria analysis; NET framework; ODBC; Optimal location; Safe reuse; Saudi Arabia; Wastewater treatment plant,0.128092781,0.0336996354,0.00811055489,0.00778233865,0.00282950397,0.509543478,0.00919563137,0.092098169,0.0366351232,0.0163367298,0.0614987612,0.0418384895,0.0135549055,0.00574184861,0.021586746,0.0114552798,
11585/863975,"Aboveground forest biomass varies across continents, ecological zones and successional stages: Refined IPCC default values for tropical and subtropical forests","For monitoring and reporting forest carbon stocks and fluxes, many countries in the tropics and subtropics rely on default values of forest aboveground biomass (AGB) from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Inventories. Default IPCC forest AGB values originated from 2006, and are relatively crude estimates of average values per continent and ecological zone. The 2006 default values were based on limited plot data available at the time, methods for their derivation were not fully clear, and no distinction between successional stages was made. As part of the 2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for GHG Inventories, we updated the default AGB values for tropical and subtropical forests based on AGB data from &gt;25 000 plots in natural forests and a global AGB map where no plot data were available. We calculated refined AGB default values per continent, ecological zone, and successional stage, and provided a measure of uncertainty. AGB in tropical and subtropical forests varies by an order of magnitude across continents, ecological zones, and successional stage. Our refined default values generally reflect the climatic gradients in the tropics, with more AGB in wetter areas. AGB is generally higher in old-growth than in secondary forests, and higher in older secondary (regrowth &gt;20 years old and degraded/logged forests) than in young secondary forests (20 years old). While refined default values for tropical old-growth forest are largely similar to the previous 2006 default values, the new default values are 4.0-7.7-fold lower for young secondary forests. Thus, the refined values will strongly alter estimated carbon stocks and fluxes, and emphasize the critical importance of old-growth forest conservation. We provide a reproducible approach to facilitate future refinements and encourage targeted efforts to establish permanent plots in areas with data gaps.",aboveground biomass; forest plots; IPCC; monitoring; secondary and old-growth forests; tropical and subtropical forests,0.00456601661,0.019241536,0.001317024,0.00395192578,0.00176446163,0.00913715176,0.0107355183,0.0226440392,0.00553388475,0.0024867286,0.0097030485,0.0312777683,0.691812158,0.00733967405,0.176281378,0.00220763404,

This study investigates the urban evolution of Terracini Street's surrounding area in the Navile district, Bologna, Italy. In the last 20 years, this area has undergone various transformations, from a suburban industrial area to a new university and residential one. First, the morphologic and infrastructural characteristics of the site are established. Then, the existing regulations (acoustic, urban, and infrastructural regulations, whether local or national) are evaluated. Next, the results of environmental noise measurements are presented. Since a heavily trafficked infrastructure is very close to the occupied public area, noise limits are severely exceeded. A noise mitigation design stage follows, focusing on a novel noise barrier design. Specifically, particular attention is paid to the visual and ecological impact of the noise barrier on the area's landscape, which must be representative of the new location of the School of Engineering. The sonic crystal technique is exploited to implement an effective noise barrier (average insertion loss of 10 dB(A) in the 200 Hz-1 kHz range), allowing air ventilation and visual transparency.

Despite the continuous projects carried out in primary school, few seems to improve health and motivation to adopt active lifestyles. Among the many projects carried out in recent years, active breaks seem to be gaining ground for their easiness of realization and sustainability over time. The active breaks proved to be very effective towards well being and cognitive activation representing an additional dose of physical activity that can help children in meeting the recommended levels of daily physical activity. Moreover, the active breaks represent an innovative strategy to improve the classroom climate and facilitate the educational action of teachers. Teachers, involved in the I-MOVE and ABS studies, of an inter-university study group (University of Bologna and University of Roma Tre), responded with great enthusiasm to the practice of active breaks. Teachers highlighted that active break produced a positive effect toward school routine, learning envi- ronment and activation of cognitive functions in children.

In our paper, we look at three bottom-up civil society organisations and collective actors fighting for greater transparency and curbing of corruption in Indian society, highlighting how they employ visuals to debate on these issues and to communicate their mission to their audiences. The focus is on how the initiatives employed visuals to discuss a particular anti-corruption policy of the central government. In particular, our paper sheds light on the dynamics between the three initiatives and the government especially at a time when democratic credentials of the country are in decline.

11585/968574,Advancing the Decarbonization of the Construction Sector: Lifecycle Quality and Performance Assurance of Nearly Zero-Energy Buildings,"Dealing with and maintaining high-quality standards in the design and construction phases is challenging, especially for on-site construction. Issues like improper implementation of building components and poor communication can widen the gap between design specifications and actual conditions. To prevent this, particularly for energy-efficient buildings, it is’s vital to develop resili-ent, sustainable strategies. These should optimize resource use, minimize environmental impact, and enhance livability, contributing to carbon neutrality by 2050 and climate change mitigation. Traditional post-occupancy evaluations, which identify defects after construction, are impractical for addressing energy performance gaps. A new, real-time inspection approach is necessary throughout the construction process. This paper suggests an innovative guideline for prefabricated buildings, emphasizing digital ‘self-instruction’ and ‘self-inspection’. These procedures ensure ac-tivities impacting quality adhere to specific instructions, drawings, and 3D models, incorporating the relevant acceptance criteria to verify completion. This methodology, promoting alignment with planned energy-efficient features, is supported by BIM-based software and Augmented Reality (AR) tools, embodying Industry 4.0 principles. BIM (Building Information Modelling) and AR bridge the gap between virtual design and actual construction, improving stakeholder communication and enabling real-time monitoring and adjustments.

While aid makes districts more attractive as migrant destinations, there is no evidence of a counterbalancing push factor effect on internal mobility. We also dig deeper into the mechanisms through which foreign aid can shape internal migration decisions.

11585/889630,Algorithmic fairness through group parities? The case of COMPAS-SAPMOC,"Machine learning classifiers are increasingly used to inform, or even make, decisions significantly affecting human lives. Fairness concerns have spawned a number of contributions aimed at both identifying and addressing unfairness in algorithmic decision-making. This paper critically discusses the adoption of group-parity criteria (e.g., demographic parity, equality of opportunity, treatment equality) as fairness standards. To this end, we evaluate the use of machine learning methods relative to different steps of the decision-making process: assigning a predictive score, linking a classification to the score, and adopting decisions based on the classification. Throughout our inquiry we use the COMPAS system, complemented by a radical simplification of it (our SAPMOC I and SAPMOC II models), as our running examples. Through these examples, we show how a system that is equally accurate for different groups may fail to comply with group-parity standards, owing to different base rates in the population. We discuss the general properties of the statistics determining the satisfaction of group-parity criteria and levels of accuracy. Using the distinction between scoring, classifying, and deciding, we argue that equalisation of classifications/decisions between groups can be achieved thorough group-dependent thresholding. We discuss contexts in which this approach may be meaningful and useful in pursuing policy objectives. We claim that the implementation of group-parity standards should be left to competent human decision-makers, under appropriate scrutiny, since it involves discretionary value-based political choices. Accordingly, predictive systems should be designed in such a way that relevant policy goals can be transparently implemented. Our paper presents three main contributions: (1) it addresses a complex predictive system through the lens of simplified toy models; (2) it argues for selective policy interventions on the different steps of automated decision-making; (3) it points to the limited significance of statistical notions of fairness to achieve social goals.",Fairness; IA; COMPAS,0.386570394,0.00279624341,0.0048136306,0.0149734886,0.0195676573,0.00173362531,0.00199339516,0.0359431915,0.00550181279,0.375939429,0.008182602,0.00278918026,0.00166205561,0.00109150796,0.00257917889,0.13386263,
11585/967962,Applicability of Face Masks as Recyclable Raw Materials for Self-Made Insulation Panels,"The circular economy model is based on the 4R framework—reduce, reuse, recycle, and recover. While recycling was the primary focus in the past, the shortage of raw materials and the desire to reduce carbon footprints have led to a change in focus: end-of-life materials are now considered resources rather than waste. When discharged, end-of-life materials still possess properties that can be exploited. For this reason, a comprehensive characterization of reusable materials is mandatory to reduce waste and increase material availability. The reuse of waste materials, such as surgical masks, is of particular interest in giving people in disadvantaged contexts the opportunity to self-produce and self-install panels within their homes, with the dual result of improving indoor comfort and increasing human capital. This paper focuses on the identification of a possible second application for surgical face masks through experimental characterization.

The objective is twofold. Firstly, to demonstrate how various AI functionalities, rather than just prediction, can be applied in this field. Secondly, to provide reflections based both on their practical (e.g., the creation of the dataset and the importance of the quality and availability of data) and legal challenges (e.g., explainability). These reflections are crucial to providing methodological suggestions concerning the future development of scientific research activity in the application of AI to the tax justice sector, and recommend a use of AI which assists rather than replaces the judge.",AI and law – Argument Mining – Outcome Prediction – Formal Ontology – Citation Network Analysis – Data availability and quality – Methodological approaches – Explicability – Judge,0.232862577,0.00627525,0.00665219733,0.0073505668,0.00563888811,0.00386011787,0.00350144575,0.0932064727,0.0203788616,0.389928937,0.00732448464,0.0153813828,0.00315059209,0.00402101967,0.00863767229,0.191829503,
11585/912972,Assess and reduce toxic chemicals in bioplastics,"Assess and reduce toxic chemicals in bioplastics To promote a circular economy and mitigate pollution, the bioplastics industry has begun to phase out polymers derived from petrochemicals (1–3). This action is a positive step, but it doesn’t affect the many bioplastics on the market, which also contain potentially harmful additives. Given that bioplastics will likely replace polymers, it is crucial to determine which bioplastics cause the least harm. Components of bioplastics can leak into the environment. After disposal, weathering and ultraviolet degradation lead to additional release of chemicals (4). When determining the safety of plastic materials, it is important to consider that such leakage could have adverse effects on ecosystems, wildlife, and humans (5–8). Discarded plastics often end up in the ocean, where chemicals leaking into the aqueous environment are toxic to marine life. Additives such as phthalates from starch- and cellulose-based bioplastics can also leak into marine environments through wastewater and runoff from landfills. The chemicals affect bioluminescent bacteria and the development of sea urchin larvae (5–7). Bio-cups, bio-polyethylene bottles, and bioplastic supermarket bags are produced with polylactide (PLA), a polyester derived from renewable biomass. PLA contains chemicals of emerging concern (CECs), such as bisphenol A, that cause dose-dependent increases of malformed mussel larvae (8). More information about the CECs in bioplastics is urgently needed. No protocols are available to characterize either the chemicals or the leachate of chemicals from conventional and bio-based plastics (9), making evidence-based, environmentally responsible management impossible. Manufacturers of plastic items and their consultants should be required to test for molecular, organismal, and population-level effects and make public the risks of each type of both conventional plastic and bioplastic (10). Integrated chemical and biological approaches should be used to assess the risks associated with low-level exposures to CECs released by bioplastics as well as their possible combined effects in mixtures. Assessing the toxicity of CECs that migrate from bioplastics into the surrounding environment could help determine how to prevent unexpected adverse health outcomes (11). Instead of replacing one harmful material with another, the bioplastic industry and researchers should work together to identify the safest and most sustainable plastic alternatives (6). Creating and prioritizing the production of nontoxic materials with a low carbon footprint could lead to a reduced need for landfills and less ocean plastic waste.",plastics; plastic additives; seawater; marine organisms,0.00184601475,0.00449108332,0.00342198042,0.00158024637,0.000889600546,0.045551423,0.015182348,0.00583198713,0.0274270885,0.00163676962,0.00918094628,0.0545553491,0.0109854303,0.7966609,0.0184779726,0.00228078081,

11585/954750,Boundary management preferences from a gender and cross-cultural perspective,"Although work is increasingly globalized and mediated by technology, little research has accumulated on the role of culture in shaping individuals' preferences regarding the segmentation or integration of their work and family roles. This study examines the relationships between gender egalitarianism (the extent a culture has a fluid understanding of gender roles and promotes gender equality), gender, and boundary management preferences across 27 countries/territories. Based on a sample of 9362 employees, we found that the pattern of the relationship between gender egalitarianism and boundary management depends on the direction of segmentation preferences. Individuals from more gender egalitarian societies reported lower preferences to segment family-from-work (i.e., protect the work role from the family role); however, gender egalitarianism was not directly associated with preferences to segment work-from-family. Moreover, gender was associated with both boundary management directions such that women preferred to segment family-from-work and work-from-family more so than did men. As theorized, we found gender egalitarianism moderated the relationship between gender and segmentation preferences such that women's desire to protect family from work was stronger in lower (vs. higher) gender egalitarianism cultures. Contrary to expectations, women reported a greater preference to protect work from family than men regardless of gender egalitarianism.

11585/819396,Built environment attributes and their influence on walkability,"Walking is a sustainable mode of transport and a healthy way of doing physical activity. Walkability is a concept that has gained enormous popularity in recent years due to its potential to promote more sustainable urban environments and healthy lifestyles. This paper provides a literature review to analyze the influence of built environment attributes on walkability. The Scopus and Web of Science databases were chosen to survey the peer-reviewed documents published up to June 2020. A total of 132 documents were selected by the search. The review of these 132 documents showed that various built environment attributes were differently analyzed and assessed. More specifically, the search identified 32 built environment attributes that were assessed by using 63 measures. Intersection density, residential density and land use mix were the most used attributes for assessing walkability, namely by using objective methods, such as ratios and spatial score tools. In turn, attributes related to streetscape design and security were much less adopted in walkability assessments. This paper provides additional insights into how built environment attributes influence walkability and identifies gaps and issues that should be analyzed in-depth in the future.

11585/800401,Coastal Monitoring System based on Social Internet of Things Platform,"Coast erosion is a process that degrades a coastal profile and is mainly due to natural factors (e.g., related to climate change) and overcrowding (e.g., urbanization and massive tourism). While the first cause can be considered a slow process, the growing presence of humans is leading to a rapid aging of coasts. The Mediterranean Sea authorities are focusing on the necessity for a systematic and comprehensive approach to the management of littoral areas. In this context, Italy is searching a promising solution to safeguard coasts but, at the same time, to manage in an intelligent and “green"" way the big amount of tourists. Research community all over the world indicated Internet of Things (IoT) as a valid technology to develop solutions in order to try solving or mitigating the coastal erosion problem. IoT-based techniques allow to manage heterogeneous and massive data for real-time monitoring and decision making and can be used for coastal environment and crowd level monitoring. This paper presents a monitoring system based on the Social IoT (SIoT), a new paradigm which defines a network where every node is an object capable of establishing social relationships with other things in an autonomous way according to specific rules. Thanks to social relationships, all involved devices in the monitoring system (i.e., sensors, cameras, and smartphones) are able to collect and exchange information.

11585/964178,Combined recovery of polyhydroxyalkanoates and reclaimed water in the mainstream of a WWTP for agro-food industrial wastewater valorisation by membrane bioreactor technology,"The present study investigated the combined production of reclaimed water for reuse purposes and polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA) from an agro-food industrial wastewater. A pilot plant implementing a two-stage process for PHA production was studied. It consisted of a mainstream sequencing batch membrane bioreactor (SBMBR) in which selection of PHA-accumulating organisms and wastewater treatment were carried out in, and a side-stream fed-batch reactor (FBR) where the excess sludge from the SBMBR was used for PHA accumulation. The performance of the SBMBR was compared with that of a conventional sequencing batch reactor (SBR) treating the same wastewater under different food to microorganisms' ratios (F/M) ranging between 0.125 and 0.650 kgCOD kgTSS-3 d-1. The SBMBR enabled to obtain very high-quality effluent in compliance with the relevant national (Italy) and European regulations (Italian DM 185/03 and EU, 2020/741) in the field of wastewater reclamation, whereas the performances in the SBR collapsed at F/M higher than 0.50 kgCOD kgTSS-1d-1.A maximum intracellular storage of 45% (w/w) and a production yield of 0.63 gPHA L - 1h- 1were achieved when the SBMBR system was operated with a F/M ratio close to 0.50 kgCOD kgTSS-1d-1. This resulted approximately 35% higher than those observed in the SBR, since the ultrafiltration membrane avoided the washout of dispersed and filamentous bacteria capable of storing PHA. Furthermore, while maximizing PHA productivity in conventional SBR systems led to process dysfunctions, in the SBMBR system it helped mitigate these issues by reducing membrane fouling behaviour. The results of this study supported the possibility to achieve combined recovery of reclaimed water and high-value added bioproducts using membrane technology, leading the way for agro-food industrial wastewater valorization in the frame of a circular economy model.",Agro-food wastewater; Food to microorganism; Membrane bioreactor; Mixed microbial culture; Polyhydroxyalkanoate; Reclaimed water,0.0074243811,0.018521376,0.00422209688,0.00452022441,0.00111493818,0.566310644,0.0242906176,0.0362376198,0.15063715,0.00239248038,0.0165669657,0.126925096,0.0117348051,0.0112041347,0.0135152014,0.00438230485,

Journal of Environmental Management,"Conservation finance embraces a series of innovative financing mechanisms aimed at raising and managing capital to be used for the conservation of biodiversity. The climate emergency and the pursuit of sustainable development underline the criticality of financial support for achieving this goal. Funding for the protection of biodiversity, in fact, has long been disbursed by governments in a residual form, only after they have dealt with social needs and political challenges. To date, the main challenge of conservation finance is to identify solutions that not only generate new revenue for biodiversity, but also effectively manage and allocate existing funding to provide a mix of social and community benefits as well. The paper, therefore, aims to act as a wake-up call, urging academics working in economics and finance to turn their attention to resolving the financial problems faced by conservation. Through a comparative bibliometric analysis, the study aims to outline the structure of scientific research on the topic of conservation finance, to understand the state of the art, and to identify open questions and new research trends. The results of the study show that the topic of conservation finance is currently a prerogative of scholars and journals of ecology, biology and environmental sciences.

11585/957301,Cost-effective adaptation strategies to rising river flood risk in Europe,"River flood risk in Europe could rise to unprecedented levels due to global warming and continued development in flood-prone areas. Here, we appraise the potential of four key adaptation strategies to reduce flood risk across Europe based on flood risk modelling and cost-benefit analysis. We find that reducing flood peaks using detention areas is economically the most attractive option. In a scenario without climate mitigation (3 degrees C global warming), they can lower projected flood losses in Europe by 2100 from euro44(30-61) billion to euro8.1(5.5-10.7) billion per year and lower population exposed by 84% (75-90%) or achieve a risk level comparable to today. The economic investment required over 2020-2100 would provide a return of euro4(3.5-6.3) for each euro1 invested. The risk reduction potential of strengthening of dykes is somewhat lower, at 70% (59-83%) for a comparable annual investment. Implementing building-based flood proofing and relocation measures is less cost-effective but can reduce impacts in localized areas.With increasing river flooding risk caused by climate and socioeconomic changes, different adaptation strategies can help to improve the resilience to the threat.

11585/529510,"Crossing barriers: Profiles of reading and comprehension skills in early and late bilinguals, poor comprehenders, reading impaired, and typically developing children","The aim of the present study was to analyze the performance of primary school children with different cognitive (specific learning disorders and poor comprehenders) or language (early and late bilinguals) profiles, considering reading and comprehension skills. In particular, it focused on a transparent orthography (Italian), complementing existing studies conducted mainly on children during their acquisition of an opaque orthography such as English, either as a first or second language. Five groups of children (N = 600) were involved in the study: children diagnosed with specific learning disorders, poor comprehenders, early bilinguals, late bilinguals, and a control group. They were tested for reading speed and accuracy of words, non-words, and text, and for reading and language comprehension when using the battery for Assessment of Reading and Comprehension in Develop- mental Age (Bonifacci, Tobia, Lami, & Snowling, 2014). Mean group differences and profiles within each group were analyzed. The comparison of different groups evidences how, within each dimension, there might be similar profiles across different groups (e.g., the same reading comprehension skills in early bilinguals, late bilinguals, and children with specific learning disorders) and highly discrepant skills within the same group (e.g., word and non-word reading in late bilinguals). These results provide some insight into the importance of assessing a complete functional profile aside from categorical classifications and reinforce the concept of dimensional models in developing trajectories of reading and comprehension skills (Snowling & Hulme, 2012).",Reading; Comprehension; Poor comprehenders; Bilingualism; Specific learning disorders,0.00167308224,0.000952052,0.00292714918,0.967579305,0.00319738127,0.00110109744,0.00107651763,0.00407839753,0.00238294061,0.00627633557,0.00142469432,0.00171170093,0.00103078946,0.000744743913,0.000997730065,0.00284591643,
11585/954966,Design of sustainable offshore hybrid energy systems for improved wave energy dispatchability,"Wave energy is a renewable energy source having a highly exploitable potential in several locations worldwide. In the framework of energy transition, the exploitation of wave energy combined with end-of-life offshore stranded gas reservoirs may lead to two positive impacts: the stabilization of the energy supplied to the grid and a better penetration of renewable energy in areas where the grid is not able to compensate the fluctuations associated to renewable energy production. Moreover, in order to guarantee the dispatched energy schedule, wave energy needs to be coupled with back-up systems aimed at valley filling. In the present study, an innovative approach to the conceptual design of hybrid energy systems based on wave energy is developed, entailing an operation strategy that complies with the dispatching needs of grid-connected generation systems. The probability of correct dispatching that the producer assures to the Transmission System Operator is used as a parameter to optimize the design of a Gas to Power back-up system used for valley filling. The approach supports the preliminary design of offshore hybrid energy systems based on wave energy, starting from historical wave data up to the definition of an optimal back-up system valorizing residual reservoir fuels and its operation strategy. The proposed design is evaluated through a Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis, including the technological, economic, environmental and safety aspects, which allows the assessment of the overall sustainability performance of the hybrid system, considering the fluctuations associated to wave power generation during a typical operation period. The methodology was applied to two test-cases in different offshore operating theaters (North and Adriatic seas), in order to test its potentiality. The results highlighted that, in both sites, similar design choices are suggested for the hybrid system. However, the annual energy production resulted 6.5 times higher in the North Sea test-case. The low energy generation in the Adriatic Sea test site caused a levelized cost of energy of 3960 EUR/MWh, much higher than the value obtained for the North Sea case (610 EUR/MWh). In both cases, the gas turbine park impacts negatively on the cost of energy production, but is critical in meeting the design value of the probability of correct dispatching.",Offshore hybrid energy systems; Sustainable design; Offshore renewable energy sources; Wave energy; Grid integration,0.00505707366,0.00579688791,0.00363940047,0.00632527051,0.00225551357,0.0145117864,0.285754919,0.0525557809,0.189548284,0.00526843779,0.00942531135,0.132568702,0.11987415,0.149266422,0.0150663126,0.00308576599,

Our analysis is performed with the factorized version of the microscopic OP obtained in a previous series of papers within the Watson multiple scattering theory at the first order of the spectator expansion, which is based on the underlying nucleon–nucleon dynamics and is free from phenomenological inputs. Differently from our previous applications, the proton and neutron densities are described with a two-parameter Fermi (2pF) distribution, which makes the extraction of the matter radius easier and allows us to make a meaningful comparison with the original analysis, that was performed with the Glauber model. With standard minimization techniques we performed data analysis and extracted the matter radius and the neutron skin. Our analysis produces a matter radius of R(rms) m = 4.12 fm, in good agreement with previous matter radii extracted from 76Kr and 80Kr, and a neutron skin of Rnp  −0.1 fm, compatible with a previous analysis. Our factorized microscopic OP, supplied with 2pF densities, is a valuable tool to perform the analysis of the experimental differential cross section and extract information such as matter radius and neutron skin. Without any free parameters it provides a reasonably good description of the experimental differential cross section for scattering angles up to ≈ 40 degrees.

11585/619803,Development of urban solar infrastructure to support low-carbon mobility,"The provision of an adequate network of urban infrastructures is essential to create clean and energy-efficient urban mobility systems. However, the urban infrastructure to support sustainable mobility can produce a substantial environmental burden if no life cycle environmental criteria are applied in its design and management. This paper demonstrates the potential to support energy-efficient and CO<inf>2</inf>-free pedestrian and electric bike (e-bike) mobility through the ecological design (eco-design) of urban elements. An eco-design approach is applied to reconceptualize a conventional pergola toward an eco-product (solar pergola). The solar pergola generates surplus photovoltaic electricity that provides a multifunctional character. According to the end-use of this energy, different scenarios are analyzed for robust decision-making. The deployment of solar pergolas can contribute to save from 2,080kg to over 47,185kg of CO<inf>2</inf> eq. and from 350,390MJ to over 692,760MJ eq. in 10 years, depending on the geographic emplacement (solar radiation and electricity grid system). These savings are equivalent to charging 2-9 e-bikes per day using clean energy. Instead of maximizing infrastructure deployment to shift to environmentally friendly modes of mobility, the implementation of multifunctional urban elements represents a key area of action in the context of smart city development.",Eco-design; Electric mobility; Green electricity; Multifunction; Pedestrian mobility; Smart cities; Energy (all); Management; Monitoring; Policy and Law,0.00793688372,0.00253897579,0.00522274524,0.011241613,0.00157808873,0.00650888029,0.14775981,0.0528910421,0.120833397,0.00596518256,0.352535,0.129363015,0.133575469,0.00473360484,0.0122814123,0.00503486115,

A trait-based analysis on salt-marsh species,"Salt marshes in urban watersheds are prone to microplastics (MP) pollution due to their hydrological characteristics and exposure to urban runoff, but little is known about MP distributions in species from these habitats. In the current study, MP occurrence was determined in six benthic invertebrate species from salt marshes along the North Adriatic lagoons (Italy) and the Schelde estuary (Netherlands). The species represented different feeding modes and sediment localisation. The 96% of the analysed specimens (330) did not contain any MP, which was consistent across different regions and sites.  Suspension and facultative deposit-feeding bivalves exhibited a lower MP occurrence (0.5-3%) relative to omnivores (95%) but contained a much more variable distribution of MP sizes, shapes and polymers. The study provides indications that MP physicochemical properties and species' ecological traits could all influence MP exposure, uptake and retention in benthic organisms inhabiting European salt marsh ecosystems.",Microplastics; Fibres; Suspension-feeders; Deposit-feeders; Omnivores; Salt marsh,0.0065058535,0.00739771221,0.02334507,0.00231252378,0.00236511067,0.145762593,0.0044953106,0.00345343072,0.00656743394,0.00589372,0.351108432,0.0118280593,0.00716039,0.335694045,0.08076673,0.00534367934,
11585/922891,Effect of Raw and Composted Anaerobic Digestates from Sewage Sludge and Biowaste on Ryegrass Phosphorous Availability and Soil Carbon Management,"Purpose: Organic waste (OW), such as anaerobic digestates and compost, can provide nitrogen (N) and valuable crop available phosphorous (P) and is a potential alternative to chemical P fertilizers, which is a non-renewable resource. However, little is known about the short- to medium-term P supply capacity of OW within the framework of optimal soil organic carbon management. Methods: In this study, four products were investigated: a sewage sludge digestate (D1) and biowaste digestate (D2), in addition to their respective composts (C1 and C2). These products were compared at 170 kg N ha-1 along with a chemical fertilizer (Chem) and digestate from animal manure (DM) in two successive tests on potted ryegrass (84 + 84 days), without (N-) and with (N+) mineral N supply (170 kg N ha-1). Their agronomic performance and apparent bioavailable P (ABP mg pot-1) were assessed. In addition, the variation in the total organic carbon (TOC), labile carbon (CL) and carbon management index (CMI) was monitored in potting soil at the end of the two growth cycles. Results: The pot test showed that after 84 days, Chem mostly exploited its ABP (95%), similar to DM, resulting in a low P inheritance over 168 days, while the compared products (D1; C1; D2; C2) ensured long-lasting P release. CL was more sensitive than Corg to changes occurring during the test, thus proving that biowaste products, especially compost (C2), gained the best CMI. Conclusions: This promising approach may provide comprehensive insight into rational P fertilization via OW soil distribution and can provide important information on its effect on overall soil carbon management, a currently notable issue, especially in the Mediterranean region.",Organic waste; Fertilization; Apparent bioavailable phosphorous; Carbon management index.,0.00228724792,0.0562613867,0.00250136456,0.00298701972,0.000877458,0.0534934439,0.0325633697,0.0420662612,0.0539438538,0.00103562023,0.0107072573,0.589983,0.103297688,0.0130895693,0.0329289362,0.00197647163,

Data collected among Italian adults (N = 407; 59.5% women) showed that individual levels of precarious manhood beliefs-according to which manhood is a social status that must be proven via public action-were related to greater sexual harassment myths acceptance in male and female respondents. Such associations were mediated by hostile sexism and benevolence toward men.

11585/935091,Enhancement of sustainable bioenergy production by valorising tomato residues: A GIS-based model,"In order to increase the utilization of renewable energy sources, the biomethane production through anaerobic digestion has notably developed over the last years. Although, it is worldwide recognized, that valorising waste resources (i.e., by-products) is an opportunity to improve the efficiency rate of the agro-industrial chains, by reducing economic and environmental impact, it is necessary to support the strategic planning development of a future sustainable biomethane chain in line to circular economy. In this study, by adopting network information technologies, the importance of a strategic planning for sustainable developing biomethane sector was highlighted, since feedstocks logistic and supply phase is a key-aspect of any bioenergy project. The developed Geographic Information Systems (GIS) – methodology, that could be applied in any territorial area considering any type of biomass, allowed to define suitable locations for allocating new anaerobic digestion plants with the aim of developing a sustainable valorisation of tomato residues, by minimising the economic and environmental impacts. The achieved results provided advanced knowledge for the literature on the topic, helping to develop an operational GIS-tool for defining sustainable strategies for planning new plants, and proved that the development of integrated approach to define sustainable strategies for resource management along the whole supply chain is crucial.",Agricultural waste; Agro-industrial by-products; Biomass; Circular economy; GIS modelling; Logistics; Renewable energy; Spatial analysis; Sustainability,0.00653505605,0.0347508416,0.00214695558,0.00823121238,0.00168534147,0.0124880718,0.118500091,0.10900785,0.153023586,0.00238318229,0.00663884496,0.434990168,0.0781662837,0.00330590107,0.0239765719,0.00416995166,
11585/658140,"Estimates of first-generation women and girls with female genital mutilation in the European Union, Norway and Switzerland","Background: Female genital mutilation (FGM) is the practice of partial or total removal of female genitalia for non-medical reasons. The procedure has no known health benefits but can cause serious immediate and long-term obstetric, gynaecological and sexual health problems. Health workers in Europe are often unaware of the consequences of FGM and lack the knowledge to treat women adequately. Objective: Our goal was to estimate the number of first-generation girls and women in the European Union, Norway and Switzerland who have undergone FGM. Before migration from FGM-practicing countries began, FGM was an unknown phenomenon in Europe. Methods: Secondary analysis of data from the 2011 EU census and extrapolation from age-specific FGM prevalence rates in the immigrantsâ_x0080__x0099_ home countries to these data were used to provide our estimates. Estimates based on census and other demographic data were compared to our results for Belgium. Results: In 2011 over half a million first-generation women and girls in the EU, Norway and Switzerland had undergone FGM before immigration. One in two was living in the UK or France, one in two was born in East-Africa. Conclusions: For the first time, scientific evidence gives a reliable estimate of the number of first-generation women and girls in Europe coming from countries where FGM is practiced. The use of census data proves reliable for policy makers to guide their actions, e.g., regarding training needs for health workers who might be confronted with women who have undergone FGM, or the need for reconstructive surgery",Europe; female genital cutting; Female genital mutilation; migrant health; prevalence; Adolescent; Adult; Africa; Age Distribution; Circumcision; Female; Developing Countries; Emigrants and Immigrants; European Union; Female; Humans; Middle Aged; Norway; Prevalence; Switzerland; Women's Health; Young Adult; Reproductive Medicine; Obstetrics and Gynecology; Pharmacology (medical),0.0151807666,0.00425446639,0.0201415755,0.00845410861,0.780773,0.000886264781,0.00127875223,0.0125373444,0.00234020874,0.124805249,0.00181014696,0.000924656517,0.00162311899,0.00216487702,0.00126884272,0.0215565786,
11585/968690,Europe and the colonial legacy: Continuity in a history to be told,"The considerations of this essay refer to the age of the ‘Second European Empires’ and are intended to address the colonial legacy in the construction of Europe. This colonial legacy will be analysed on three levels: ideological, political, and economic. The essay is divided into two parts. The first part analyzes the relationship between international law and colonial law in French colonialism, highlighting the ideology of assimilation contained in colonial law. The ideology of assimilation - through which the will to affirm the superiority of the colonizer is expressed - persists in the reality of contemporary France and represents the continuity of the ideology of colonial rule in the current reality of a previous colonial power. Toward the close of the 19th century the vastness of the colonial empire dictated the need of introducing the political idea of association which meant the relation of cooperation but between a ‘superior’ and an ‘inferior’. We can find this doctrine of association in the 1957 Treaty of Rome, which provided for the association of the overseas countries and territories with the nascent European Economic Community. Moreover from an economic point of view the theory of the ‘stages of development’ was at the origin of the representation of the backwardness of the ‘savage’ in relation to the condition of development of the ‘advanced’ European countries. On this basis, the complementarity relationship between the African colonies and the colonial powers was defined’ The second part of the essay analyses the doctrine of ‘Eurafrica” which enunciated the complementary relationship between Africa and Europe and was the basis for the creation of the EEC.  The essay also develops the analysis of the decolonization process by assuming a non-Eurocentric perspective and underlines the need for a multi-level analysis to examine the complexity of the issues that were at the origin of the construction of Europe after the Second World War.",Colonial legacy - Colonial law - Assimilation - Stages of development - Building of Europe - Eurafrica,0.0311759356,0.00538792321,0.00646244455,0.0103050768,0.00868528336,0.00176632544,0.00148943567,0.142412692,0.0163606293,0.6512236,0.010148122,0.00764899561,0.00538368337,0.0131792063,0.00672003301,0.0816506669,
11585/818660,Evaluating interventions with victims of intimate partner violence: a community psychology approach,"Purpose. Intimate Partner Violence (IPV) is one of the most common forms of domestic violence, with profound implication for women's physical and psychological health. In this text we adopted the Empowerment Process Model (EPM) by Cattaneo and Goodman (2015) to analyse interventions provided to victims of IPV by a Support Centre for Women (SCW) in Italy, and understand its contribution to women’s empowerment.  Method. We conducted semi-structured interviews with ten women who had been enrolled in a program for IPV survivors at a SCW in the past three years. The interviews focused on the programs’ aims, actions undertaken to reach them, and the impact on the women’s lives, and were analysed using an interpretative phenomenological approach. Results. Results showed that the interventions provided by the SWC were adapted according to women's needs. In the early phases, women’s primary aim was ending violence, and the intervention by the SCW was deemed as helpful to the extent it provided psychological support, protection and safe housing. Women’s aims subsequently moved to self-actualisation and economic and personal independence which required professional training, internships, and social support. Although satisfying the majority of the women’s expectations, other important needs (e.g., economic support or legal services) were poorly addressed, and cooperation with other services (e.g., police or social services) was sometimes deemed as critical. Conclusions. By evaluating a program offered by a SCW to IPV survivors through the lens of the EPM model, we found that women deemed the program as effective when both individual resources and empowerment processes were promoted.

11585/915387,Evaluating the impacts of nutrients recovery from urine wastewater in Building-Integrated Agriculture. A test case study in Amsterdam,"Recent studies concerning the integration of agricultural practices in cities demonstrated that Urban Agriculture (UA) can boost new sustainable urban developments. New technologies allow to integrate soil-less cultivation in- and on- mixed-use buildings, creating new synergies between the built environment and the urban food system. Accordingly, resource flows from buildings are an untapped opportunity for the creation of circular urban metabolisms that rely on recycling waste as input for food production systems. On this trail, this research work focuses on evaluating the feasibility of using urine and greywater streams as nutrient solution in a theoretical model of Building-Integrated Agriculture (BIA) located in Amsterdam. Results showed that it is feasible to use urine and greywater as nutrient solutions (NS). However, treated urine showed higher concentration of macronutrients compared to fertilizer recipes found in literature, and therefore needed to be diluted with increasing amount of greywater to match either N or P concentration. Accordingly, P deficiencies in the plants or excessive N concentration were found in the final wastewater-based NS. Future research is highly recommended to assess the quality of plants grown in BIA systems as well as the possible content of harmful viruses and bacteria in the harvested produce.",wastewater; building-integrated agriculture; circular buildings; green walls,0.0109412381,0.0784832239,0.0060579665,0.00540866284,0.00144898822,0.291490257,0.0102559067,0.0568122491,0.0456005074,0.00281899516,0.11776454,0.285002768,0.0153050739,0.00712367659,0.0592752546,0.0062106289,

Particularly noteworthy has been the substantial involvement of scientific experts in media coverage and their exposure to the public’s advice. With the symbolic launch of Vaccine Day, the role of science communication experts has proven to be instrumental in effectively promoting interventions supporting vaccine choices through mass media and addressing instances of misinformation that can cause social alarm. From the perspective of studies concerning the interaction between science and society, we aim to investigate the construction of the expert’s image and scientific communication. This will be accomplished by comparing the self-representation of experts visible in Italy through their content published on social networks with their media representation in daily newspapers. Specifically, we intend to analyze all cultural products extracted using keywords such as «vaccine», «expert/scientist», «COVID/coronavirus» and a list of 33 experts selected from a preliminary survey, individually associated with the keywords during the COVID-19 vaccination campaign.

In this era of increasing environmental consciousness, banks are incorporating environmental considerations into their credit rating methodologies, like the Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financial Guidelines. In the meantime, the advent of digital tokens offers new avenues for energy token creation. This study establishes a factor model as the fundamental framework for algorithmic energy tokens and employs gradient-boosting tree regression to examine energy price drivers in Italy and Austria. The results underscore the heightened motivation to invest in energy transition and security during periods of elevated energy prices. Conversely, the drive to invest in clean energy sources diminishes when operational profits are low or energy security must be maintained. This research elucidates on an innovative financing solution that handles these dynamics, produces momentum, and focuses special emphasis on its potential for implementing environmental policies by developing an algorithmic energy token mechanism based on environmental regulations and considerations.",Green energy Transition; Digital finance; Italy; Austria,0.0284024477,0.00768315513,0.00274470891,0.0155559089,0.00400311965,0.00413261121,0.0745313764,0.288538426,0.101030067,0.0286057387,0.00677871052,0.144930214,0.255355239,0.00624097092,0.0230451636,0.00842223596,
11585/953498,First evidence of widespread positivity to anticoagulant rodenticides in grey wolves (Canis lupus),"Second-generation Anticoagulant Rodenticides (ARs) can be critical for carnivores, due to their widespread use and impacts. However, although many studies explored the impacts of ARs on small and mesocarnivores, none assessed the extent to which they could contaminate large carnivores in anthropized landscapes. We filled this gap by exploring spatiotemporal trends in grey wolf (Canis lupus) exposure to ARs in central and northern Italy, by subjecting a large sample of dead wolves (n = 186) to the LC-MS/MS method. Most wolves (n = 115/186, 61.8 %) tested positive for ARs (1 compound, n = 36; 2 compounds, n = 47; 3 compounds, n = 16; 4 or more compounds, n = 16). Bromadiolone, Brodifacoum and Difenacoum, were the most common compounds, with Brodifacoum andBromadiolone being the ARs that co-occurred the most (n = 61). Both the probability of testing positive for multiple ARs and the concentration of Brodifacoum, and Bromadiolone in the liver, systematically increased in wolves that were found at more anthropized sites. Moreover, wolves became more likely to test positive for ARs through time, particularly after 2020. Our results underline that rodent control, based on ARs, increases the risks of unintentional poisoning of non-target wildlife. However, this risk does not only involve small and mesocarnivores, but also large carnivores at the top of the food chain, such as wolves. Therefore, rodent control is adding one further conservation threat to endangered large carnivores in anthropized landscapes of Europe, whose severity could increase over time and be far higher than previously thought. Large-scale monitoring schemes for ARs in European large carnivores should be devised as soon as possible.",Brodifacoum; Bromadiolone; Food chain; Large carnivore; Rodenticide baits; Rodents; Top predator,0.00248106034,0.0124427844,0.00294656656,0.00164857483,0.00143400137,0.00666434551,0.00212108181,0.00199606665,0.00155416329,0.00169426599,0.00457291119,0.00962098222,0.00371157727,0.00999231,0.9334777,0.0036416084,
11585/841904,From religion to conservation: unfolding 300 years of collective action in a Greek sacred forest,"Sacred Natural Sites are integrated-coupled systems with mutual social and natural interactions, and they exist within a variety of local cultures and regions of the world. In Europe and especially in the Mediterranean basin, changing land use patterns and population decline since World War II have had a dramatic impact on the socio-ecological structure and management practices of many of such sites. At the same time, old beliefs and taboos are often neglected due to modernization, rural depopulation, and change in community's structure, norms, and codes. Understanding how social, ecological, and policy processes changed through time becomes thus relevant to identify the main criteria for effective collective action and sustainability of the studied systems. In this paper, we applied Ostrom's social–ecological systems framework to model the main socio-ecological processes acting upon a sacred forest in Epirus (Greece) over a 300 years' period. The multidisciplinary approach included collection of archival and ecological data and ethnographic research (semi-structured interviews). Results indicate that significant changes have occurred in social, economic, political, and institutional terms since the creation of the settlement (17th century). However, the sacred grove has been of major importance to the adjacent local community that acts as its custodian guardian even nowadays. Collective action for the preservation of the forest has been achieved under various governance regimes that transformed through time traditional religious taboos into modern conservation approaches. This analysis revealed that local traditional management practices of commons can serve as successful socio-ecological conservation examples.",Adaptive policies; Common pool resources; Forest commons; Ostrom framework; Sacred natural sites; Socio-ecological systems,0.0046341694,0.0233025458,0.00191916828,0.00376704824,0.0010997213,0.0133275129,0.00261632632,0.0131877111,0.0041161594,0.00274260039,0.012988368,0.0647566617,0.00629611732,0.0106374677,0.828825,0.00578343868,
11585/883717,Global-scale changes to extreme ocean wave events due to anthropogenic warming,"Extreme surface ocean waves are often primary drivers of coastal flooding and erosion over various time scales. Hence, understanding future changes in extreme wave events owing to global warming is of socio-economic and environmental significance. However, our current knowledge of potential changes in high-frequency (defined here as having return periods of less than 1 year) extreme wave events are largely unknown, despite being strongly linked to coastal hazards across time scales relevant to coastal management. Here, we present global climate-modeling evidence, based on the most comprehensive multi-method, multi-model wave ensemble, of projected changes in a core set of extreme wave indices describing high-frequency, extra-tropical storm-driven waves. We find changes in high-frequency extreme wave events of up to ∼50%-100% under RCP8.5 high-emission scenario; which is nearly double the expected changes for RCP4.5 scenario, when globally integrated. The projected changes exhibit strong inter-hemispheric asymmetry, with strong increases in extreme wave activity across the tropics and high latitudes of the Southern Hemisphere region, and a widespread decrease across most of the Northern Hemisphere. We find that the patterns of projected increase across these extreme wave events over the Southern Hemisphere region resemble their historical response to the positive anomaly of the Southern Annular Mode.

11585/889209,"Grandparents, family solidarity and the division of housework: evidence from the Italian case","As a consequence of recent socio-demographic trends and labour market transforma- tions the role of grandparental support has become pivotal in individuals’ and house- holds’ life courses. In Southern European countries the availability of grandparents affects young couples’ labour market participation and fertility decisions. In the present paper, it is asked if the potential availability of social support from the older family gen- eration is associated with more or less inequality in the division of unpaid housework in couples with minor children, in Italy. Using data from the 2016 Family and Social Subjects survey it is shown that while there is not a clear relation between intergen- erational face-to-face contacts and the symmetry of the division of household labour, adult children and older (grand)parents coresidence is associated with a more gender- equal sharing of housework within couples, arguably because co-residing grandpar- ents take on the execution of a number of household tasks. The observed effect is comparable to that of hiring a paid housekeeper and higher than hiring a babysitter. Thus, despite one may think that three-generation households are characterized by a culture of traditional norms, our findings indicate that they have a more gender-equal division of housework.",Grandparents; Gender; Housework; Household labour; Child care,0.272964954,0.0128355511,0.00483945059,0.0171234515,0.231805161,0.00157334819,0.00201907498,0.224908665,0.00824363902,0.169861749,0.00413000491,0.00480172085,0.005015139,0.00154513295,0.0024135937,0.035919372,

One of the tools used for this purpose is the issuance of green bonds. We analyze the characteristics of banks that issue green bonds to understand: (i) which banks are more likely to resort to these funding instruments, and (ii) if the issuance of green bonds leads to an improvement in a bank’s environmental footprint. We find that large banks and banks that had already publicly expressed their support for a green transition are more likely to issue green bonds. Conditional on being a green bond issuer, smaller banks tend to resort to green bonds in a more persistent manner and for relatively larger amounts, while larger banks issue green bonds on a more occasional basis and for smaller amounts. This heterogeneity is also reflected in our findings that only banks that issue green bonds more intensively improve their emissions and reduce lending to polluting sectors, thus contributing to the decarbonization of the financial sector.",Green banking; Green bonds; Decarbonization; Sustainable finance,0.0233037323,0.00880543888,0.0027072262,0.0152614163,0.00242633233,0.00322328554,0.0159382932,0.439448,0.113566458,0.0390614457,0.00949690491,0.198757157,0.0864597559,0.00771802617,0.0224235337,0.0114029031,

Despite its increasing relevance, there is a lack of understanding of factors influencing the environmental behavior of people from emerging economies. In this study, we focus on the role of formal education for pro-environmental behavior in the Philippines and study three potentially underlying mechanisms explaining the education effects: differential knowledge about climate change, risk perceptions, and awareness. Whilst there is some evidence showing that education is associated with pro-environmental behavior, little is known about the actual mechanisms through which it influences decision-making. Using propensity score methods, we find that an additional year of schooling significantly increases the probability of pro-environmental actions, e.g. planting trees, recycling, and proper waste management, by 3.3%. Further decomposing the education effects, it is found that education influences behavior mainly by increasing awareness about the anthropogenic causes of climate change, which may consequently affect the perception of self-efficacy in reducing human impacts on the environment. Knowledge and perceptions about climate risks also explain the education effect on pro-environmental behavior, but to a lesser extent.",developing country; education; mechanisms; mediation analysis; Philippines; pro-environmental behavior,0.00763579179,0.0112415841,0.00328736566,0.105005614,0.00353548303,0.0059154667,0.0233330503,0.165666133,0.0670540184,0.00561821135,0.0225161593,0.27582705,0.271395594,0.00384130282,0.0201649182,0.00796229858,

The scarcity of water impacts agricultural production, while its quality influences the safety of agricultural products and consequently public health. A sustainable way to supplement agricultural production and industrial water needs stands in the reuse of wastewater. Moreover, it is so necessary to develop smart, sustainable and efficient wastewater treatment technologies in terms of construction and management cost for small communities. Natural wastewater treatment systems represent a cost-effective treatment, already tested and implemented all around the world. In this context, this study focuses on horizontal sub-surface flow phytotreatment systems implementation with the aim to understand the processes and features involved to optimize both design and technical management phases. This work is a continuation and extension of previous studies conducted by the authors and focuses on nitrification and denitrification processes. To this aim, a pilot plant located on Bertalia-UNIBO campus in Bologna was monitored to evaluate the nitrification-denitrification efficiencies related to seasonal variation of Temperature, dissolved oxygen at different hydraulic retention time. The pilot plant was charged with a domestic wastewater and the emergent macrophytes were Phragmites australis. The tests show good nitrification efficiencies in summer (from 78% to 91%) at HRT more than 12 h and the resulting data were stable at 30h. Winter nitrification efficiencies are lower than summer (44%, 66%) at HRT more than 12 h. As expected, dissolved oxygen was greater in winter than summer. Denitrification efficiency were in the range 40% - 75%, increasing with HRT.

If insufficiently addressed, climate change will exacerbate poverty and inequality within and across nations. Addressing it requires that people in developed and developing countries adopt new behaviors and technologies to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions and to adapt to a changing climate. A major contribution of the 2019 Nobel Laureates consists in providing new tools to advance knowledge on the mechanisms driving the diffusion of non-normative behaviors, by combining social network analysis with field experiments.

With reference to the Algerian - European relationships, we analyze the broad context where an environmental policy benefitting both developing and developed countries can be put in place. We then discuss the connection between anthropogenic CO2 emissions and acidification of Oceans along with a geo-engineering proposal aimed at solving these pressing problems with large-scale solar-powered chloralkali plants. While the cost of sequestering a ton of CO2 with dedicated chloralkali plants is unacceptably high, it is economically and environmentally sound to replace an existing European Cl-2 plant (consuming fossils) with a solar-powered plant in Algeria. If the Algerian plant uses a new, more efficient chloralkali process, it will be competitive with existing European plants even at the current low market value of the carbon emission credits.

11585/949696,Hydrogen transportation and distribution,"Hydrogen needs to be transported and distributed by a reliable delivery infrastructure, proportional to the demand, from the production plant to end-users such as hydrogen refueling stations. Currently, there are three main pathways for hydrogen delivery, tube trailers, and pipelines mainly for the gaseous form of hydrogen, and cryogenic tankers for the liquid form. Pipelines are used to supply high-demand districts and for users such as large industrial users, while tube trailers and medium cryogenic tankers are mainly used for smaller customers and closer distances. However, large cryogenic tankers are used for transport through the sea which is more affordable in comparison to pipeline installments in the marine environment for general export. Several challenges in each pathway should be addressed to reach a sustainable and affordable pathway. Pipeline pathway challenges are its high cost, probability of leakage, hydrogen embrittlement (HE) of steel pipelines, problems in geological storage such as contamination and leak, selection of preferred pipeline route, and monitoring and maintenance. Tube-trailers pathway challenges are the necessity of high resistance tubes and reliable compressors to reach desired high loading pressure and high storage cost. Cryogenic tanker pathway challenges are cost, specialized liquid hydrogen ship, boil-off at tank wall and during unloading at the refueling station, and high cost to reach very low temperature. There is another pathway for hydrogen transportation with so-called carrier materials. These are synthetic chemicals such as methanation, ammonia, liquid organic hydrogen carriers (LOHC), and metal hydrides. These materials for hydrogen transport and metal hydrides are in the technology development stage for commercialization. The safety issue is an integral part of all pathways which is related to the physical and chemical properties of hydrogen; especially issues related to untrained people refueling cars and domestic consumption. The pipeline is likely to be the safest and most economical way of hydrogen distribution considering the lower likelihood of accidents and exposure to humans. In this chapter, in addition to providing information regarding various pathways, environmental impact, cost, policies, and safety issues, a hydrogen transportation model is proposed which can be used to optimize the total cost of hydrogen delivery from several hydrogen production plants to end-users.",Economic; Greenhouse gas footprint; Hydrogen; Transport; Tube trailer,0.00684011355,0.00612872,0.0045064576,0.00574261043,0.00238575577,0.0162545554,0.0560095645,0.0709289685,0.154057175,0.00996892154,0.0167204533,0.0966225863,0.136701316,0.401415884,0.0112050278,0.00451191468,
11585/910144,Hydrological regimes in different slope environments and implications on rainfall thresholds triggering shallow landslides,"Assessing hazard of rainfall-induced shallow landslides represents a challenge for the risk management of urbanized areas for which the setting up of early warning systems, based on the reconstruction of reliable rainfall thresholds and rainfall monitoring, is a solution more practicable than the delocalization of settlements and infrastructures. Consequently, the reduction in uncertainties affecting the estimation of rainfall thresholds conditions, leading to the triggering of slope instabilities, is a fundament task to be tackled. In such a view, coupled soil hydrological monitoring and physics-based modeling approaches are presented for estimating rainfall thresholds in two different geomorphological environments prone to shallow landsliding. Based on the comparison of results achieved for silty–clayey soils characterizing Oltrepò Pavese area (northern Italy) and ash-fall pyroclastic soils mantling slopes of Sarno Mountains ridge (southern Italy), this research advances the understanding of the slope hydrological response in triggering shallow landslides. Among the principal results is the comprehension that, mainly depending on geological and geomorphological settings, geotechnical and hydrological properties of soil coverings have a fundamental control on the timing and intensity of hydrological processes leading to landslide initiation. Moreover, results obtained show how the characteristics of the soil coverings control the slope hydrological response at different time scales, making the antecedent soil hydrological conditions a not negligible factor for estimating landslide rainfall thresholds. The approaches proposed can be conceived as an adaptable tool to assess hazard to initiation of shallow rainfall-induced landslides and to implement early-warning systems from site-specific to distributed (catchment or larger) scales.",Hillslope hydrology; Hydrological modeling; Physics-based rainfall thresholds; Rainfall-induced shallow landslides; Soil hydrological monitoring,0.00531449914,0.0016642001,0.00544560514,0.00229035132,0.000474442,0.0117709124,0.0034638017,0.0128233302,0.0348337814,0.00349674141,0.868352473,0.0284465589,0.00458681164,0.00325532793,0.00945686,0.00432426622,

The European Green Deal and Farm to Fork (FtF) Strategy stress the importance of the sustainable transition of food systems that emphasize resilience and justice along food chains. In this direction, education and training (ET) are given a major role, constituting one of the pillars of the Agricultural Knowledge and Innovation Systems (AKIS) framework. This study aims to propose an extended version of the AKIS framework to focus on the transition of policies concerning the ET pillar and to use this framework as a conceptual background with which to identify strategies for the improvement of ET policies in the AFF sectors. Data collection was undertaken through a round of workshops, and the data were analyzed using a thematic analysis approach. The results revealed that the need for a high-quality educational policy and the need to enhance collaboration, entrepreneurship and innovative learning methods were among the most important for the sector, where urgent changes in pace and an approach in ET are necessary for the entire value chain, from farm to fork.

After analysing the evolution of inequality and poverty on the continent during the last decades and discussing their causes, the chapter considers the short circuit between inequalities and democratization within the countries of Southern Africa, a region historically beset by racial discrimination and high poverty rates, whose governments today show a growing predisposition to authoritarian practices.

Given the different objectives pursued, transfer pricing and customs law approach the issue in quite different ways, which often leads to discrepancies, complications and inconsistencies to be addressed by multinational businesses. The international business community and international organizations aim for an alignment of the two approaches, but so far no concrete legal solutions have been reached. In the market of the European Union (EU), indeed, the European Court of Justice (ECJ) addressed the issue of the potential interplay between the two legal systems in the Hamamatsu case. However, the position held by the ECJ is not clear, nor are the consequences arising this case law. The result is that a stronger alignment between the two depends to a large extent on the administrative practices in the local EU countries. This article aims at providing a comprehensive examination of the current strategy used by a number of Member States (Spain, Italy, the Netherlands, and Germany) both before and after Hamamatsu, and explores local practices used to reconcile transfer prices and customs values.

This is particularly relevant in exposed glazed façade during summer, where the risk of excessive solar radiation and light entering the building is elevated. The study proposes the use of Dialux software to support the design of sunshading devices with the two-fold objective of reducing the risk of glare along the façade side and avoiding a dark effect on the opposite side. The procedure is based on a multiple-design approach that simulates the effect of diverse shading panel configurations on indoor illuminance distribution. Then the procedure is implemented on a residential case study in Bologna (Italy) resulted in having a limited depth and thus a high risk of excessive illuminance. The results demonstrate that Dialux is sensitive to changes in the openness factor and geometry of the panel. The multiple simulations allowed the optimal illuminance level of around 300 lux for more than 70% of the case study room surface while containing the area exceeding the optimal level under 1000 lux to less than 20% and to avoid reaching the minimum threshold of 100 lux through a shading system with Openness Factor ranging between 11 and 15%.

In our sample households pay an annual fee proportional to the number of emptyings of their bin for unsorted waste. We exploit the variation in the bin sharing policy to estimate the production of unsorted waste when bins are shared or not. We find that unsorted waste production is lower when two households share the same bin compared to households not sharing the bin. This result does not hold when more than two households share the same bin, possibly due to lack of visibility of the individual action.

A promising application for recycled aggregates is for the realization of rural roads and pavements. The agricultural context, characterized by particular type of traffic and need to balance performance and integration with the environment, is suited for the use of these materials for paved surfaces since it can promote, in several cases, the adoption of rural circular processes internal to the farm. However, if on one hand the adoption of recycled aggregates could increase the sustainability of the sector, on the other it could increment the environmental loads if the whole process is not properly organized. For instance, the negative effects of transportation operations can cancel the environmental benefits if high distances between the production and the destination sites are present. This work reports the results of the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), from cradle-to-gate, of four different construction aggregate classes that can be used for the realization of rural roads, pavements and forecourts, and paved areas in agricultural environment. The first three materials are recycled aggregates produced by the recycling processes of construction and demolition waste and the fourth type refers to gravel aggregates produced from natural resources. The Life Cycle Assessment was realized using site-specific primary data from the local territorial context and paying particular attention to transportation-related impacts, land use, avoided landfill and preservation of non-renewable resources. The results of the work clearly show that the environmental impacts in both scenarios of recycled aggregates are lower than the virgin aggregate scenario. In fact, considering the midpoint categories, the recycled materials proved to be more virtuous in almost all the indicators, with the exception of except for the marine eutrophication. The most significant gap between virgin and recycled materials has been in global warming and marine and freshwater eco-toxicity.",LCA; Construction and demolition waste; Agricultural paved surfaces; Recycled aggregates; Sustainability.,0.00511735352,0.0383022688,0.00346712978,0.00373591436,0.00166754413,0.0373372659,0.0156031037,0.0531175248,0.0471990332,0.00256732828,0.0227812883,0.272468328,0.0937879,0.36214906,0.037229009,0.00346985529,

11585/143135,Liberalization within Diversity: Welfare and Labour Market Reforms in Italy and the UK,"Are advanced democracies converging on a liberalized economic model, revolving  around increasing penetration of markets and the decline of egalitarian institutions? The literature has  tended to polarize between proponents of convergence and scholars who emphasize of the resilience of  the distinct models of welfare capitalism. This article argues that although there is no strong evidence of  convergence, the distribution of income in advanced democracies is becoming more unequal, suggesting  significant change in a liberalizing direction. The article develops this argument by charting changes to  the political economy of labour in two large European democracies: Italy and the United Kingdom. Despite belonging to entirely distinct ‘families’ of welfare capitalism, they have both undergone extensive  changes to their political economy in the past three decades. We find that Italy and the UK were very  different political economies in the 1970s, and remain very different today, but they have both undertaken reforms which have weakened egalitarian institutions and led to dramatic increases in poverty and  inequality. This suggests that a focus on the diversity of institutional legacies and the distinct reform  paths that we observe in advanced democracies should not distract from the conclusion that marketfocused economic reforms in very different institutional contexts can still lead to the same outcome: the  privatization of economic risk and increased income inequality.",welfare capitalism; inequality; italy; united kingdom; economic reform,0.842198491,0.00492793275,0.00208441634,0.00246291514,0.00666895229,0.00174534624,0.00125282188,0.0455352329,0.00310783205,0.0703723282,0.00388385495,0.00187486853,0.00222699344,0.000841975212,0.00213708286,0.00867890473,
11585/963110,Life cycle assessment of stone consolidants for conservation of cultural heritage,"The field of the conservation and repair of built cultural heritage shows a growing attention towards the environmental sustainability of materials and treatments used for conservation projects. As a standardized methodology that is widely adopted for the comparative evaluation of construction and building materials, life cycle assessment (LCA) can be usefully applied to conservation materials, if specific field-related issues on the definition of functional units and reference flows are properly addressed. In the present study, LCA is used to quantify the environmental footprint of four alternative consolidants for restoration of weathered carbonate substrates. An innovative treatment based on an aqueous solution of diammonium hydrogen phosphate (DAP) is compared against three commercial alternatives (lime nanoparticles, ethyl silicate, and acrylic resin). The issue of the definition of the reference flow (i.e., the amount of each consolidant required for the restoration of a given surface) is addressed through experimental tests on three model substrates (marble, limestone, and lime mortar), following two alternative criteria: i) application until apparent refusal, as recommended by product manufacturers, and ii) application to obtain a certain degree of consolidation, in terms of increase in compressive strength. The novel DAP consolidant is shown to have lower impacts than the alternatives on several environmental impact categories, mainly thanks to the absence of organic solvents in its formulation. The evaporation of volatiles after application (volatile organic compounds for the commercial consolidants, ammonia for the DAP consolidant) is highlighted as an environmental hotspot for all the consolidants.",Life cycle assessment; LCA; Conservation; Built heritage; Ammonium phosphate; Nanolimes; Ethyl silicate; Paraloid B72,0.00353737269,0.0045686136,0.00346568506,0.00610007439,0.000917961,0.0162787046,0.0125742937,0.0204579923,0.0344593227,0.00218881317,0.218244821,0.593804359,0.0153590282,0.0130782304,0.0439709313,0.0109937657,
11585/956374,Multi-objective study on an innovative system for domestic hot water production: A pilot building in Southern Europe,"The present study deals with a multi-objective analysis of an innovative decentralised system to produce and store domestic hot water (DHW), emphasising on the combined effects of the technological aspect, control strategy and user's behaviour. The proposed system, by relying on thermal energy storage, decouples energy production and demand while shaves peaks in the energy demand and, at the same time, provides more autonomy to users through local storages. To identify subtle interactions in components of DHW system, dynamic simulations are carried out by establishing a coupled TRNSYS-MATLAB code, calibrated and validated by experimental measurements. The energy analysis implies that the proposed system cuts the required annual electrical energy in half, of which up to 82% of needed primary energy is supplied from renewable sources, compared to previous electrical-decentralised system. The optimisation of the results through applying control strategies indicates that adopting a three-time charging scheme is advantageous in terms of providing a more stable temperature profile as well as a higher hot water temperature. Compared to an available-by-demand operation, this scheme reduces the required total annual electricity by 5.2 % and enhances total thermal loss from components up to 4.0%. Furthermore, a sensitivity analysis on the results emphasises the striking role of the user behaviour in electrical energy consumption either via draw-off temperature or adjusting the pre-defined temperature for activation of the built-in auxiliary heater.",Domestic hot water (DHW); Storage tank; Energy storage; User behaviour; Dynamic simulation,0.00569699565,0.00626031589,0.00407236768,0.00443996117,0.00221163477,0.228784502,0.517523348,0.0088135954,0.058528956,0.00160372478,0.00612133788,0.0514066145,0.0860618204,0.00914970413,0.00670752116,0.00261765043,
11585/965064,New design models for proximity retail and senior inclusion,"According to the world health organization (WHO) the impact of the pandemic on the population aged 60 years or over still need further assessment. Besides biological and physiological risk factors, indirect risk factors derived from loneliness and exclusion must be considered. When asked about the impact of social distancing and isolation over the course of the lockdowns, many seniors reported a degree of physical and mental deterioration. The prolonged restriction of mobility caused a lack of confidence in their walking ability and less motivation to spend time outside, leading to sedentary behavior. In some cases, the pandemic increased awareness about ageing itself, but this was often perceived as a negative rather than positive life transition (Phillipson et al., 2021). Mobility is generally associated with active ageing and has several benefits on the individual’s quality of life, whereas a sedentary lifestyle amplifies age related conditions. Studies have shown that the most ordinary everyday activities, such as shopping, can have long-term health benefits. As a matter of fact, this simple daily activity can stimulate cognitive processes and provide physical benefits while promoting social engagement. Older adults who preserve social interactions are proved to have 50% increased chance of living longer than the isolated ones (Holt-Lunstad et al., 2010). Going out of home and interact with public spaces such as supermarkets, is therefore essential to seniors as they allow them to feel connected with the local community maintaining their identity favoring the process of active ageing. In the given context a strategic design approach can help shaping a different proximity retail format which can enable “time-rich” senior users to engage in a unique form of “convenience-shopping” revolving around social interaction and convivial relationship, rather than on a time-saving and automated experience.

The central role of occupants for achieving energy savings is increasingly recognised, and it is even more important in the social housing sector, where the environmental value is combined with the social purpose of reducing inequalities and fuel poverty. The paper examines the existing energy policy instruments and the current analysis methods in relation to occupant behaviour. Strategies to promote behaviour changes are investigated, and the co-benefits of implementing such actions in the social housing sector are highlighted in order to move from behaviour change to systemic change. Four initiatives in Europe (Italy, the Netherlands, Sweden and UK) are further investigated to understand the effects of occupant behavioural change towards lower energy consumption in the social housing sector. A comparative matrix for the analysis of the four practices is developed to highlight their common characteristics and divergences, to finally point out opportunities and barriers towards energy efficiency.",Behaviour change; Policy instrument; Renovation strategy; Social housing,0.51657021,0.0125184534,0.00502081774,0.00627771067,0.00797951687,0.00497841183,0.013604708,0.112108573,0.0106727313,0.0778029,0.0366095081,0.0111302705,0.160525665,0.00265498064,0.0132377641,0.00830784347,
11585/901236,Ocean Acidification as a Governance Challenge in the Mediterranean Sea: Impacts from Aquaculture and Fisheries,"Despite the progress in the international and regional governance efforts at the level of climate change, ocean acidification (OA) remains a global problem with profoundly negative environmental, social, and economical consequences. This requires extensive mitigation and adaptation effective strategies that are hindered by current shortcomings of governance. This multidisciplinary chapter investigates the risks of ocean acidification (OA) for aquaculture and fisheries in the Mediterranean Sea and its sub-basins and the role of regional adaptive governance to tackle the problem. The identified risks are based on the biological sensitivities of the most important aquaculture species and biogenic habitats and their exposure to the current and future predicted (2100) RCP 8.5 conditions. To link OA exposure and biological sensitivity, we produced spatially resolved and depth-related pH and aragonite saturation state exposure maps and overlaid these with the existing aqua culture industry in the coastal waters of the Mediterranean basin to demonstrate potential risk for the aquaculture in the future. We also identified fisheries’ vulnerability through the indirect effects of OA on highly sensitive biogenic habitats that serve as nursery and spawning areas, showing that some of the biogenic habitats are already affected locally under existing OA conditions and will be more severely impacted across the entire Mediterranean basin under 2100 scenarios. This provided a regional vulnerability assessment of OA hotspots, risks and gaps that created the baseline for discussing the importance of adaptive governance and recommend ations for future OA mitigation/adaptation strategies. By understanding the risks under future OA scenarios and reinforcing the adaptability of the governance system at the science-policy interface, best informed, “situated” management response capability can be optimised to sustain ecosystem services.","Ocean governance; Sustainability Knowledge systems; policy foundations and thematic analysis; Ocean policy and management; Earth's ecosystems, water and coasts; Fish, fisheries and seafood resources; Marine energy and mineral resources; Open Access;",0.00523942756,0.0175426472,0.00220166217,0.00277108722,0.00250642747,0.0212837197,0.00847167,0.0405998193,0.0132349348,0.00557333231,0.00795697048,0.0346242748,0.288391352,0.509564817,0.0363031588,0.00373467803,

11585/957088,Organizing for transformative innovation policies: The role of social enterprises. Theoretical insights and evidence from Italy,"Transformative innovation policies can provide systemic solutions to socio-environmental challenges because of their ""experimental"", ""reflexive"" and ""inclusive"" character. We contend that social enterprises can act as catalysts for transformative innovation for the geographically and socially marginalized. Thus, including social enterprises in transformative innovation policies can mitigate the negative effects of innovation-based growth, making policies more socially and geographically inclusive. Following a syncretic approach to the literatures on trans -formative innovation policies and social entrepreneurship, this paper identifies the key dimensions of social enterprises' transformative innovation potential: directionality (i.e., social goals as the purpose of innovation); social and geographical inclusiveness (i.e., the inclusion of marginalized areas and individuals in the provision of goods or services); reflexivity (in terms of participatory governance and monitoring the achievement of goals); and experimental character (in terms of establishing partnerships with heterogeneous actors). We then assess this capacity through an exploratory cluster analysis of Italian social enterprises. We identify three distinct groups that suggest a range of entrepreneurial approaches from largely transformative to not at all. The transformative innovation readiness of social enterprises has implications for policymakers seeking to undertake pilot schemes and implement actions that support an appropriately transformative innovation ecosystem.",Social entrepreneurship; Social enterprise; Transformative innovation; Innovation policy; Inclusive innovation,0.0308055822,0.00478994846,0.00235831924,0.0288263615,0.00956483465,0.00383020495,0.0072544734,0.14964743,0.0656597316,0.0362971276,0.00858159643,0.0915179104,0.00544081628,0.00301531237,0.0117654884,0.540644884,
11585/664347,Performance and operation of micro-ORC energy system using geothermal heat source,"In the electricity production sector, geothermal energy is considered a reliable energy source because of its independence of seasonal, climatic and geographical conditions. Low-temperature geothermal wells present a huge potential of exploitation, as the development of binary cycles and the technological improvement in drilling make this heat source a competitive solution for electricity generated distribution and self-consumption. The Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) is currently the best solution to convert heat into electricity using low enthalpy heat sources. The ORC technology is already mature and widespread for medium and large-scale power plants, applying for geothermal, solar, biomass or waste heat recovery exploitation. Micro-scale ORC applications are still not diffused in the market: the system layout, the working fluid selection and the expander architecture can significantly vary depending on the specific realization requirements, thus a standard configuration has not established yet. In this paper, a particular case study of a micro-ORC power system using a geothermal well is presented. The application in analysis is a plug-and-play ORC facility, currently installed and operating in a pool centre. The system layout and the main components are described. The heat source is a geothermal well, which continuously supplies (by pressure difference) liquid water at a temperature lower than 60°C to a binary Rankine cycle working with R134a. The ORC system is driven by a prototypal radial-piston expander and adopts an external-gear feed pump and a recuperative cycle. It is developed for working continuously, delivering the generated electricity directly into the grid. The facility is provided with temperature, pressure and electric power sensors for monitoring the operation and for a preliminary evaluation of the performance. The global efficiency of expander and feed pump and the ORC net efficiency have been evaluated at the regular working conditions of the geothermal well, showing values equal to, respectively, 53 %, 41 % and 4.4 %.",experimental analysis; geothermal; low temperature heat sources; micro-ORC; piston expander; Energy (all),0.00197032164,0.00367011945,0.00208341074,0.00317452312,0.0010676817,0.027076317,0.463423461,0.0122086061,0.133574143,0.000862960238,0.00661652675,0.261050165,0.0662723929,0.00730785029,0.00798394065,0.00165758608,
11585/945915,Performance of lagoon and constructed wetland systems for tertiary wastewater treatment and potential of reclaimed water in agricultural irrigation,"Climate change poses challenges to agricultural water resources, both in terms of quantity and quality. As an adaptation measure, the new European Regulation (EU) 2020/741 establishes different water quality classes for the use of reclaimed water in agricultural irrigation. Italy is also working on the definition of a new regulation on reclaimed water reuse for agricultural irrigation (in substitution of the current one) that will also include the specific requirements imposed by the European one. Nature-based Solutions (NBS) can be a cost-effective and environmentally friendly way to facilitate water reclamation and reuse. The present study reports the outcomes of a long-term monitoring campaign of two NBS (e.g., a constructed wetland (CW) and a lagoon system (LS)) comparing influent and effluent concentrations of different contaminants (e.g., E. coli, BOD5, TSS, TN and TP) with the threshold values imposed by the new regulations. The results showed that in both the case studies, E. coli (about 100&nbsp;CFU 100&nbsp;mL-1) and BOD5 (lower than 25&nbsp;mg&nbsp;L-1) mean effluent concentration need to be further reduced in reclaimed water to be suitable for unlimited reuse. As a negative aspect, in both the monitored NBS, an increase in TSS mean concentration in the effluent was observed, up to 40&nbsp;mg&nbsp;L-1 in the case of the LS, making reclaimed water unsuitable for agricultural reuse. The CW has proven to be more effective in nitrogen removal (the effluent mean concentration was 3.4&nbsp;mg&nbsp;L-1), whereas the LS was better at phosphorus removal (with an effluent mean concentration of 0.4&nbsp;mg&nbsp;L-1). Based on the results, recommendations were made to further improve the performance of both systems in order to have adequate water quality, even for class A. Furthermore, the capacity of reclaimed water to meet crop water and nutrient needs was analyzed, and total nitrogen removal rate coefficients were calculated for the design of future LSs.",(EU) 2020/741; Agricultural irrigation; Constructed wetlands; Lagoon systems; Wastewater treatment; Water reuse,0.0169283226,0.283716649,0.00373612181,0.00285754981,0.00275267544,0.300100058,0.00936140586,0.0477091111,0.00893044844,0.00358788436,0.00941909291,0.032700561,0.224366546,0.0123210978,0.0386308655,0.00288166641,

Totally in accordance with the circular economy statements, sustainable materials could be obtained by the reconversion of wastes, e.g., solid wastes coming from urbanized area and agricultural wastes. This research stems from the need to exploit wastes coming from livestock processes, i.e., sheep wool fibers (SWF), and their potential reuse as reinforcement for rammed earth building components. To this aim, experimental trials were performed to get useful information on the mechanical properties of SWF in wet environments like those present in lime mixes.

An index of Integrated Sustainable Development is introduced to measure local sustainable development on an internationally-comparable scale. This Index is computed both at the national and subnational level and the resulting scores are compared within and across the two countries, also through the adoption of convergence and cluster analysis, allowing to answer four questions: Are the US and China moving towards a sustainable development agenda? Are the current achievements uniformly distributed within the two countries? Are states/provinces converging towards a more uniform level of sustainable development? Do the existing differences and analogies between states and provinces give rise to common clusters across the two countries? The results lead to one robust conclusion: while the US can claim a better result in the national and subnational rankings of sustainable development, China exhibits a more balanced achievement in terms of synergies across Goals and spatial distribution.

Two composts obtained from different composting processes were tested as biostimulating agents. At the end of the trial, the effect of plant/compost combinations on soil microbial composition, contaminant removal, biochemical indicators, and plant biomass production was determined. The results highlighted that compost addition improved plant biomass despite slowing down plants' removal of organic and inorganic contaminants. In addition, compost partially enhanced the soil biochemical indicators and modified the relative abundance of the rhizosphere microorganisms. Sorghum showed better mitigation performance than Brassica due to its higher growth.

Unraveling the consequences of the ongoing climate changes on this delicate environment is essential to ensure the future safeguard of this basin. To tackle this problem, we developed a biogeochemical model for the entire basin, with a horizontal resolution of about 2 km and 120 vertical levels, forced by the projections of atmosphere, hydrology and ocean circulation between 1992 and 2050, under emission scenario RCP8.5. The changes projected between 2031–2050 and 1992–2011 were evaluated on ecoregions characterized by different trophic conditions, identified using a k-medoid classification technique. The results point toward a generalized oligotrophication of the basin, especially intense in the northern estuarine areas, driven by a substantial decrease in river discharge projected for the rivers of the Po Plain. This scenario of unproductive and declining resources, together with the ongoing warming, salinization, and acidification of marine waters, cast doubt on the long-term resilience of the Northern Adriatic food web structure, which has evolved to thrive in high trophic conditions. The outcome of this study provides the stakeholders with a tool to understand how potential long-term decreases in the regimes of the Northern Adriatic Rivers could affect the marine ecosystem and its goods and services in the future.",Adriatic Sea; biogeochemistry; oligotrophication; BFM; ecoregions of the Adriatic Sea; decrease in river discharge,0.00806647,0.0256370325,0.00327555253,0.00225382322,0.00306368293,0.0206940845,0.00677804323,0.0433031097,0.00954597164,0.0092249345,0.0121058077,0.0155019546,0.448559016,0.364733189,0.0242768209,0.00298048533,

Although traditional cartographic methods using a geographic information system (GIS) are applicable in image classification, machine learning (ML) methods present more advantageous solutions for pattern-finding tasks such as the automated detection of landscape patches in heterogeneous landscapes. This study aimed to discriminate landscape patterns along the eastern coasts of Mozambique using the ML modules of a Geographic Resources Analysis Support System (GRASS) GIS. The random forest (RF) algorithm of the module ‘r.learn.train’ was used to map the coastal landscapes of the eastern shoreline of the Bight of Sofala, using remote sensing (RS) data at multiple temporal scales. The dataset included Landsat 8-9 OLI/TIRS imagery collected in the dry period during 2015, 2018, and 2023, which enabled the evaluation of temporal dynamics. The supervised classification of RS rasters was supported by the Scikit-Learn ML package of Python embedded in the GRASS GIS. The Bight of Sofala is characterized by diverse marine ecosystems dominated by swamp wetlands and mangrove forests located in the mixed saline–fresh waters along the eastern coast of Mozambique. This paper demonstrates the advantages of using ML for RS data classification in the environmental monitoring of coastal areas.

The destruction of El Castillejo and the discovery of the earliest historic earthquake affecting the Granada region (Spain),"This paper discusses recent archaeological fieldwork conducted at El Castillejo, a medieval Islamic settlement in Los Gua´ jares, Granada, southern Spain. Results from combined archaeological excavation and archaeoseismological assessment of standing structures suggest that the site was affected by a destructive earthquake during its occupation. Radiocarbon samples and OSL analysis point to a seismic event in the period CE 1224–1266. The earthquake occurred within an area marked by a ‘seismological gap’ in terms of historic seismicity and the causative fault has been tentatively identified in the Nigu¨elas-Padul Fault System which lies north of the settlement. This event is not recorded by national or European seismic catalogues and represents the oldest historic earthquake in the Granada area.

11585/908803,Remote sensing analysis on primary productivity and forest cover dynamics: A Western Ghats India case study,"Tropical forest ecosystems are among the most essential habitats on Earth for conserving biological diversity and short-term climate regulation. For this reason, they are key areas of conservation policies in the world. In this paper, we aim to investigate the dynamics of forest cover and their changes in primary productivity by empowering information on historical forest management and fieldwork research with remote sensing vegetation monitoring methods. The study area falls within the central portion of the Indian Western Ghats, a global biodiversity hotspot. In particular, part of the analysis was performed on the Kadamakal Reserve Forest and Pushpagiri Wildlife Sanctuary, which harbours an endemic low elevation dipterocarp evergreen forest. This area was managed by selective logging and became fully protected in 1984. We performed multiple time series macroscale analyses between 1999 and 2020 on the Indian Central Western Ghats region, using satellite products at 1 km spatial resolution from the VITO Copernicus Global Land Service on Dry Matter Productivity, Fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation, and Normalised Difference Vegetation Index. We also performed a very-high spatial resolution Normalised Difference Vegetation Index differential analysis between 2021 and 2016 with Sentinel 2-L2A products to investigate forest dynamics within the reserve. At the 1 km spatial reso­lution has been found an increase in all three vegetation indices, by employing the LOESS statistical method for the smoothed transition autoregressive model of raster data medians of our datasets. The boxplot raster distri­bution analysis also highlighted a significant imbalance in dry matter productivity in the last decade (2010− 2020) comparing the previous one (1999–2009). The second part of the analysis, at 10 m spatial reso­lution within the reserve forest, revealed a growth in the vegetation cover on the top of the Pushpagiri Mountain ridge and in a previously landslide area. The study found new erosion channels down to the upper plateau on the South-West side of the reserve due to an increment of the run-off processes during the monsoon period. This satellite analysis highlighted generalised positive vegetation trends in the Central Western Ghats, India, over the last twenty-two years, enhancing an improvement in the ecosystem functioning and carbon storage ecosystem service. Notably, through this work, we also developed a standardised and open-access framework to monitor the vegetation remotely (SVIT) during periods of forest inaccessibility for fieldwork sampling.",Biodiversity hotspot;Ecosystem monitoring;Forest management;Open-source software;Time series analysis;Vegetation indices,0.00704524713,0.0355176292,0.0013257385,0.00456107035,0.00170926901,0.018855039,0.00827448443,0.0354478806,0.00657909689,0.00281690154,0.0134944683,0.054939311,0.277309299,0.00895565096,0.520002425,0.00316650257,

Income surveys are generally planned to produce reliable estimates at countries or macroregion levels, thus we implement a small area model for a set of inequality measures (Gini, Relative Theil, and Atkinson indexes) to obtain reliable microregion estimates. Considering that inequality estimators are unit-interval defined with skewed and heavy-tailed distributions, we propose a Bayesian hierarchical model at the area level involving a Beta mixture. An application on EU-SILC data is carried out and a design-based simulation is performed. Our model outperforms in terms of bias, coverage, and error the standard Beta regression model.

Environmental impacts and high management costs affect the sustainable development of cities, an issue that is exacerbated by the lack of social involvement. The research conducted in Iran aims to assess the benefits of organic waste home composting in Shiraz to improve solid waste management (SWM) sustainability. The introduction of a pilot project to assess home composting systems was described, together with an economic, social and environmental analysis. The current SWM system (S0) has been compared with the new strategy proposed (S1), where home composting is considered to be introduced to collect about 10% of the municipal solid waste generated in a 10-year horizon. An economic balance related to the capital costs and operational costs of both systems was introduced, in parallel with a life cycle assessment (LCA) of the SWM system, and a questionnaire survey of the local population. Results showed that S1 leads to around 5% economic savings for the municipality due to the avoidance of organic waste transportation and disposal. Environmental benefits include a lowering of CO -Eq emissions of about 19,076tonnesyear−1. In addition, about 28% of the interviewed (n=319) agreed 2 to employ the home composting system at home (CI 5.5%, 95% of confidence level) supporting the theory that about 10% of the organic waste can be segregated and home-composted.

11585/653313,Soddisfazione lavorativa ed equilibrio casa-lavoro: un’analisi di genere,"Job satisfaction is an attitude related not only to work but also to extra-work experiences, because it affects household arrangements and fertility behaviour. In a context like Italy, characterized by the male breadwinner model, men and women are expected to attach different relevance to the domains of work and family; thus, it is interesting to see how gender moderate the association between job quality and job satisfaction. In other words, if male and female workers look for different things in work, their way of living their job could be different. This work inquires if the association between job quality and job satisfaction has the same magnitude and direction for men and women, and if not, in what the gender pattern diverges. In order to link the domains of work and family, the study is focused on the time dimension of job satisfaction: indeed, this dimension is the most influent for the chance of dealing with the .double role. (paid work and duties of care), and so the most suited to explore the differences between men and women. The results underline that with low duties of care (without a young child in the household) women are more satisfied than men in good jobs, while with high duties of care (with a young child in the household) women are more satisfied than men also in jobs of medium quality. Women with high duties of care especially appreciate technical professions, such as secretary, teacher, nurse, characterized by fixed schedule and clear contents; such features connote jobs as family-friendly, allowing mothers to handle working-life balance smoothly. Besides this difference, the general pattern of response to parenthood is similar between men and women: On a demand side, this may be explained with the fact that the Italian labour market is not well suited for mothers who want to remain in the paid work, and, on a supply side, with the alignment of parenthood practices between mothers and fathers.",Labor Force and Employment; Size; and Structure; Time Allocation and Labor Supply; Safety; Job Satisfaction; Related Public Policy,0.0587188713,0.0229044259,0.00614047563,0.0448002443,0.345954895,0.00204011076,0.00359302852,0.390024781,0.0232950449,0.0491976626,0.0038159308,0.0113375541,0.00846569799,0.00229274109,0.00300096557,0.0244175401,

The benefits provided depend on the quality of the landscape, but also on the real possibility for people to access and enjoy it. One of the best ways is to do it in a “slow” way, namely active and non-motorized, through a soft mobility network. The goals of the study are: (i) to develop a methodology to plan a soft mobility network that enhances existing infrastructures and maximizes the cultural ecosystem services provided by rural landscapes; (ii) to validate the methodology in the Alto Ferrarese territory through defining a soft mobility masterplan at the supra-municipal scale. The method is made up of three phases: analysis, with the inventory of the resources to be connected and the paths that could potentially be used; assessment, with the evaluation of the suitability of the paths to realize the soft mobility network; and planning, with the definition of the masterplan for the study area. The application resulted in a proposed network of 525.2 km, hierarchized in a primary and a secondary network, and proved that the methodology is effective to maximize the use of existing paths (81% of the proposed network), and to connect the elements of interest (98.5% of the resources are within a distance of 500 m, and 86.4% within a distance of 100 m).",soft mobility network; planning; rural tourism and recreation; rural landscape; cultural ecosystem services,0.00919512846,0.020505568,0.00169772131,0.0137667581,0.00190905889,0.00968135893,0.0086982036,0.177185789,0.0585169531,0.00319819245,0.027337037,0.620636582,0.0118924454,0.00288578751,0.0255042166,0.00738926837,

The present paper aims to identify both the reasons and the legal implications of this phenomenon, moving from a reconstruction of the doctrine elaborated by EU institutions to support this new approach, that is, the Strategic Autonomy Doctrine (SAD). Building on the assumption that the Union is now facing evolving threats, requiring a stronger capacity to protect the supranational interests and values, the paper argues that the reshaping of the EU-Member States security nexus has led to the creation of a buffer zone, where EU’s and Member States’ prerogatives for the protection of both (supra)national security and sovereignty are significantly blurred. This, in turn, produces significant consequencces for the EU constitutional framework, namely a hybridization of both the supranational competences and legal instruments concerned.",supranational security; national security; strategic autonomy doctrine; principle of conferral; principle of sincere cooperation; EU constitutional framework; common commercial policy; investments screening; economic coercion,0.0578388236,0.00472658966,0.0046184524,0.00698598288,0.00740063842,0.00334791141,0.00292403647,0.150803179,0.0315115266,0.260604471,0.00882718246,0.0258636493,0.00531396642,0.00825585146,0.0085788155,0.412398905,

Aims: This longitudinal study compared the impact of symbolic and non-symbolic trainings in a group of preschoolers at risk of developing difficulties in mathematics (RM), analyzing their post-intervention performance both in early math skills (last preschool year) and in mathematics achievement in 1st grade. Methods: Eighty-nine RM children and 66 typically developing controls were selected from among 604 preschoolers. RM children were assigned to three intervention conditions: no intervention, symbolic or non-symbolic intervention. Results: Results showed specific effects on tasks related to the training (e.g., effects of symbolic training on symbolic tasks) and some effects of generalization (e.g., effects of symbolic training on non-symbolic tasks). In 1st grade, children attending the symbolic intervention showed a mathematics achievement profile similar to that of typically developing peers.

11585/681342,Systems for rainwater harvesting and greywater reuse at the building scale: A modelling approach,"In the light of water shortages, frequently affecting many regions worldwide, domestic rainwater harvesting, and greywater reuse systems represent an alternative source of water. This study fits this framework providing a hydraulic/hydrological model developed by means of the EPA’s Storm Water Management Model. The model has been applied to a case study, which consists of an apartment building located in the city of Bologna and equipped with a hybrid rainwater-greywater recycling system. Cold, hot and recycled water consumptions were monitored for four flats located in the same building. Data analysis shows that the recycled water consumption accounts for a third of the total one, when considering only the supply for toilet flushing, while in garden flats, where recycled water is used also for watering, non-potable water consumption accounts for about 56% of the total. Continuous simulations were performed with 13 years daily rainfall data, and the long-term performance of different system combinations were evaluated. The case study shows a non-potable water saving efficiency of 75.86%, which accounts by 26.71% of the mains water withdrawal. Simulations performed by changing system type demonstrated that, due to the high number of inhabitants and of the great extension of the areas to be irrigated, the contribution of rainwater harvesting is moderate. In fact, non-potable water saving efficiency curves tend to flatten as the values of the tank volume increase. Furthermore, the system demonstrates a good ability in lowering both stomwater runoff and greywater volumes.",Grey water recycling; Rain water harvesting; SWMM; Water saving; Environmental Engineering; Pollution; Management; Monitoring; Policy and Law,0.0104439855,0.00905197952,0.00647507841,0.00376410945,0.000961071171,0.484413266,0.0110576125,0.0218092315,0.0382170789,0.00265576714,0.177073181,0.177215,0.0136717539,0.0123317093,0.0243310947,0.0065279766,

The relationships between the per capita self-reported amount of food waste (expressed in kilocalories) and self-declared dietary habits (traditional, healthy and sustainable, vegetarian, smart, and confused) were estimated using multiple linear regression models. The results showed that smart diets are associated with higher values of food waste in Canada, Spain, the UK, and the USA. Vegetarian diets are associated with lower food waste values in China, Germany, the UK, and the USA, but not in Italy, Russia, and Spain.

The analysis of several in-depth interviews with companies and industry key experts results in a process model that is apt to provide granular insights on the implementation of end-of-life circular practices. From the findings it emerges that in the quest to reduce the carbon footprint, the implementation of upcycling and remanufacturing needs to rely on the assessment of the multiple barriers that attain circularity, that the latter can be boosted by adequate marketing positioning strategies, and that companies need to spend considerable effort in filling the cultural gap, by also implementing other end-of-life circularity practices.",Grand Challenge; Circular Economy; Upcycling;  Remanufacturing; Fashion Industry.,0.00500774058,0.00938618835,0.00160697312,0.00748337526,0.00285966927,0.00278819771,0.0329485498,0.119976267,0.109614313,0.00495182071,0.0102688633,0.0995839462,0.575146496,0.00459072227,0.00974630285,0.00404052157,

Additionally, we document that the impact of creditor protection laws is mitigated by tax system characteristics, which significantly reduce the incentives to substitute tax avoidance with debt.",Government policy and regulation; bankruptcy; debt; capital structure; tax;avoidance,0.188107565,0.00335034123,0.00547909923,0.0036444026,0.00969567057,0.00262306281,0.00245151483,0.0805340856,0.0148001574,0.457598597,0.0107804704,0.0133991763,0.00382705661,0.00528458,0.00718368078,0.191240489,
11585/606169,The Social Roots of the Gender Gap in Political Participation: The Role of Situational and Cultural Constraints in Italy,"The paper takes an innovative approach to the study of political participation by combining it with a gender studies perspective, investigating the role of structural and situational constraints in the highly gendered context of Italy. We test the role of 'Family arrangements' (the combination of marital status and number of children) and 'Domestic work' (hours spent in non-paid work) on the propensity to participating in political activities (institutional and non-institutional). 'Such constraints channel women’s time away from politics, but neither do they account for the whole difference, which calls for an additional explanation, identified with specific cultural constraints (which go back to processes of political socialization). As expected, there is a remarkable gap between women and men in traditional time-consuming political activities and situational constraints have a negative impact on women’s participation, and surprisingly also have a negative effect on men’s involvement.",Political participation; Gender gap; Situational constraints; Structural constraints; Cultural constraints; Conventional and non conventional political activities,0.0154288951,0.00291393255,0.0048058778,0.00910614803,0.704966,0.00131436647,0.00142766093,0.0153497383,0.00245026127,0.030607881,0.00179758691,0.00235362421,0.00184636086,0.00157962274,0.0015196763,0.202532277,
11585/909682,The impact of education on the Energy Trilemma Index: A sustainable innovativeness perspective for resilient energy systems,"This study investigates the association between the Energy Trilemma Index (ETI) (which measures secure, affordable, and sustainable energy) and a country's level of education from a sustainable innovativeness perspective. We analyze if school life expectancy (SLE) and the students' predispositions towards STEM degrees (science, technology, engineering or mathematics) can stimulate the creation of sustainable and resilient energy systems. We perform a regression analysis based on data from 118 countries, and we employ both an ordinary least squares (OLS) regression and a robust-to-outliers MM-estimator. The statistical investigation reveals that the higher the school life expectancy, the higher the ETI. By contrast, we find no significant association between the ETI and the percentage of STEM graduates. So what matters in energy sustainability is the number of persons who decide to continue tertiary studies rather than their attitudes towards studying scientific subjects. This research paper contributes to the literature on renewable energy, circular economy (CE), sustainable innovation, and knowledge management by demonstrating how education can aid in implementing energy systems that adhere to the triple bottom-line approach (society, economy, and environment). Thus, sustainable and resilient energy systems can be spurred by not only environmental and economic variables but also social ones. Therefore, the traditional approach of the CE for achieving sustainable development should be substituted by alternative CE approaches that consider social variables. From the managerial standpoint, a high SLE can foster resilient energy systems through the creation of ad hoc policies, the birth of new companies connected to the renewable energy sector, and new organizational forms of energy management handled directly by citizens.",Energy Trilemma Index; Energy sustainability; Education; Sustainable innovativeness; Energy management,0.00973462313,0.00477377605,0.00264742784,0.444518477,0.00600285362,0.00500614615,0.0439101346,0.179153293,0.116146713,0.00954659563,0.00508567505,0.11763458,0.0311810672,0.00260793464,0.0105389394,0.0115118027,
11585/966447,"The implementation of NRRP policies between
politics and policy. An interest group perspective","In Italy, the effective implementation of the National Recovery and Resilience Plan (NRRP) represents an even greater and more difficult challenge than its formulation. Implementation of the majority of the ambitious projects outlined in the plan and the required policy reforms necessitates the active participation of economic and social stakeholders, interest groups and major corporations, and a swift improvement in administrative capacities – especially at the subnational government level. Analysing the implementation of the NRRP from the perspective of interest groups provides crucial insights into its potential impact on the Italian economy, society and political system. This viewpoint also illuminates the intricate connections between politics and policy in managing cross-sectoral reforms with substantial financial resources. Therefore, utilizing process tracing methodology allows for an in-depth analysis of the implementation of sectoral policies, unveiling causal mechanisms, identifying key actors, and recognizing evolving trends in policies central to the Plan itself, such as those related to competition, justice and the green and digital transitions.

A cross-population comparison with children with specific learning disorders,"Background: Very preterm (VPT) children showed delays in reading, spelling and maths, but their academic achievement profile is not clearly understood. Aims: VPT children were compared with children with specific learning disorders (SLD) and typically developing (TD) children on academic achievement, considering cognitive and linguistic phenotypic markers. A learning profile analysis was also performed. Methods: We included 170 10-year old monolingual Italian-speaking children (37 VPT, 28 SLD, 105 TD) assessing cognitive, linguistic and academic skills. Results: On academic achievements VPT children fell behind TD peers in some reading (text speed, comprehension), spelling (non-word), and math (number knowledge, written calculations and problem-solving) tasks. SLD children underperformed in all academic tasks with respect to VPT and TD peers. Concerning cognitive and linguistic phenotypic markers, compared to TD peers, VPT children showed lower scores in verbal IQ and phonological fluency, SLD children in phonological processing and rapid automatized naming. VPT children showed a higher rate of at-risk performance in reading compared to TD group, but a minor percentage of impaired profiles and comorbidity among learning areas compared to SLD group. Conclusions and implications: The academic achievement profile of VPT children shows persistent delays, but it differs to that of SLD children, since delays are less widespread and severe, and differences were found in phenotypic markers and comorbidity.

11585/942242,Traditional vs. novel approaches to coastal risk management: A review and insights from Italy,"Coastal areas frequently face critical conditions due to the lack of adequate forms of land use planning, environmental management and inappropriate coastal risk management, sometimes leading to unexpected and undesired environmental effects. Risk management also involves cultural aspects, including perception. However, the acknowledgement of risk perception by stakeholders and local communities, as one of the social pillars of risk analysis, is often lacking.. Starting from an overview of the risk concept and the related approaches to be addressed, the paper investigates the evolution of  coastal risk management with a focus on the Italian case study. Despite the design and adoption of national policies to deal with coastal risks, coastal management still shows in Italy a fragmented and poorly coordinated approach, together with a general lack of attention to stakeholder involvement. Recent efforts in the design of plans aiming at reducing risks derived from climate change and mitigating their impacts (National Strategy on Climate Change Adaptation; National Climate Change Adaptation Plan; National Recovery and Resilience Plan activities) should be effective in updating knowledge about climate change risks and in supporting national adaptation policies.",Erosione costiera; difesa del litorale; monitoraggio,0.0102508012,0.0193095617,0.00325484085,0.00243145227,0.00339693064,0.0143495826,0.00413682498,0.0330233648,0.00544776116,0.0115936203,0.0161682498,0.0310512241,0.226639807,0.557115197,0.0512334071,0.0105974451,
11585/883708,Urban heat island mitigation by green infrastructure in European Functional Urban Areas,"The Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect is one of the most harmful environmental hazards for urban dwellers. Climate change is expected to increase the intensity of the UHI effect. In this context, the implementation of Urban Green Infrastructure (UGI) can partially reduce UHI intensity, promoting a resilient urban environment and contributing to climate change adaptation and mitigation. In order to achieve this result, there is a need to systematically integrate UGI into urban planning and legislation, but this process is subject to the availability of widely applicable, easily accessible and quantitative evidence. To offer a big picture of urban heat intensity and opportunities to mitigate high temperatures, we developed a model that reports the Ecosystem Service (ES) of microclimate regulation of UGI in 601 European cities. The model simulates the temperature difference between a baseline and a no-vegetation scenario, extrapolating the role of UGI in mitigating UHI in different urban contexts. Finally, a practical, quantitative indicator that can be applied by policymakers and city administrations has been elaborated, allowing to estimate the amount of urban vegetation that is needed to cool summer temperatures by a certain degree. UGI is found to cool European cities by 1.07 °C on average, and up to 2.9 °C, but in order to achieve a 1 °C drop in urban temperatures, a tree cover of at least 16% is required. The microclimate regulation ES is mostly dependent on the amount of vegetation inside a city and by transpiration and canopy evaporation. Furthermore, in almost 40% of the countries, more than half of the residing population does not benefit from the microclimate regulation service provided by urban vegetation. Widespread implementation of UGI, in particular in arid regions and cities with insufficient tree cover, is key to ensure healthy urban living conditions for citizens.",Ecosystem services; Microclimate regulation; Nature-based solutions; Urban green infrastructure; Urban heat island,0.0101414789,0.00572091853,0.00326704932,0.00940346159,0.00159575033,0.00657235226,0.0251078121,0.106296949,0.0765497833,0.00697083,0.305917054,0.175036311,0.223170504,0.00526147615,0.0315225385,0.00746569457,
11585/657540,Using Adaptation Insurance to Incentivize Climate-change Mitigation,"Effective responses to climate change may demand a radical shift in human lifestyles away from self-interest for material gain, towards self-restraint for the public good. The challenge then lies in sustaining cooperative mitigation against the temptation to free-ride on others' contributions, which can undermine public endeavours. When all possible future scenarios entail costs, however, the rationale for contributing to a public good changes from altruistic sacrifice of personal profit to necessary investment in minimizing personal debt. Here we demonstrate analytically how an economic framework of costly adaptation to climate change can sustain cooperative mitigation to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. We develop game-theoretic scenarios from existing examples of insurance for adaptation to natural hazards exacerbated by climate-change that bring the debt burden from future climate events into the present. We model the as-yet untried potential for leveraging public contributions to mitigation from personal costs of adaptation insurance, by discounting the insurance premium in proportion to progress towards a mitigation target. We show that collective mitigation targets are feasible for individuals as well as nations, provided that the premium for adaptation insurance in the event of no mitigation is at least four times larger than the mitigation target per player. This prediction is robust to players having unequal vulnerabilities, wealth, and abilities to pay. We enumerate the effects of these inequalities on payoffs to players under various sub-optimal conditions. We conclude that progress in mitigation is hindered by its current association with a social dilemma, which disappears upon confronting the bleak consequences of inaction.",Collective risk; Game theory; Natural disasters; Public goods; Risk reduction; 2300; Economics and Econometrics,0.255347639,0.0123461038,0.00456186337,0.00523923431,0.00526164798,0.00366660929,0.00769919902,0.200838059,0.0135367634,0.129015237,0.04560275,0.0165666118,0.261449665,0.00463133678,0.0200008117,0.0142364716,

Fatalities and relevant damage to properties were recently caused by wildfires affecting the Wildland-Urban and Wildland-Industrial Interfaces. Industrial sites storing large quantities of hazardous materials are vulnerable to interface fires, which have the potential to trigger specific cascading events such as Natech scenarios followed by domino effects. The present study aims at providing a methodology for the quantitative assessment of the vulnerability of industrial sites exposed to wildfires. The approach provides a novel framework for the identification and quantification of all the chains of failures that may occur due to wildfires or interface fires approaching industrial sites. The methodology accounts for the thermal radiation from fires in both primary Natech scenarios and cascading scenarios triggered by domino effects. The dynamic features of interface fires and the synergistic effects of multiple fires are also taken into account. The results of a case study demonstrated the importance of considering the dynamic behavior of wildfire, which strongly affects the vulnerability of industrial structures.

11585/841898,What to do with mushroom pickers in my forest? Policy tools from the landowners’ perspective,"Wild mushroom picking is a growing recreational and commercial activity. In Spain, wild mushrooms legally belong to the landowner, who seldom benefits from trade in mushrooms or from their recreational value. Cultural aspects (tradition, picker-related harms) and economic aspects (costly forestry works, income opportunities) constitute elements of the debate on how to deal with mushroom picking. Through a survey of private forest owners in Catalonia (north-eastern Spain), this paper examines their experiences with mushroom pickers, the factors shaping their related policy preferences and their willingness to engage in mushroom reserves. The results show broad support for introducing mushroom picking norms. A regulation would allow outsider pickers to enter private land, but only under certain conditions, i.e. to comply with socio-ecological rules of the area. Among respondents who support the regulation, active land owners who report instances of picker-related harm (both tangible and intangible) tend to support the establishment of a fee system which could be reinvested into forest management. That is also the position of the respondents who perceive mushrooms as a private right, i.e. they believe to have a legitimate right to exclude outsider pickers and, eventually, to raise revenues from that asset. On the contrary, forest owners who conceive mushroom picking as a free-access activity prefer neither to regulate it nor to charge fees. The option to establish a mushroom picking reserve depends on the landholder being a fee-supporter and perceiving instances of harm. Harm, instead, is mainly determined by the perception of congestion of pickers, which in turn is determined by the mushroom productivity of their forest, their level of privacy protection and their involvement to the primary sector. These findings help policymakers to better understand the logic and sensitivities of forest owners in view of designing mushroom picking policies that can effectively solve picker-landowner conflicts.",Ecosystem services; Non-industrial private forest owners; Non-wood forest products; Policy instruments; Property rights; Wild products,0.0354044512,0.0693802238,0.00320495013,0.00858475734,0.00322873,0.0176540092,0.00652821315,0.0860837623,0.0198646765,0.0132041285,0.0224129893,0.239566684,0.00774372555,0.00646182802,0.425245017,0.0354318395,
11585/764546,Women in Organized Crime,"This paper discusses the extent, the characteristics and the most controversial issues related to the presence of women in organized crime. Some specific topics are analysed: women in some criminal organized activities, like human trafficking, smuggling and drug trafficking, and women in gangs and Italian mafia organizations. The presence of women in organized crime is an important, though still understudied, issue. The overview of the existing literature shows that theories of organized crime can benefit from a better understanding of women offending in this context, and that gendered studies and feminist criminology can improve this knowledge and offer important and new insights on these phenomena. It also shows that understanding women roles, behaviors, motivations and life stories in all these forms of organized crime  challenges traditional and established concept like: victims, perpetrators, violence, and agency. Women, in all the context analysed, are still in between passive and subordinated roles, and more active and powerful positions and behaviors. Borders between victims and perpetrators are often blurred. They often tend to replicate male models, and there is still little space for a real emancipation in the close social environments of Italian mafia groups and gangs. More research is needed in particular on the role of globalization dynamics and technological changes tha affect criminal behaviors in this field, on the concept of masculinity, that is at the core of some criminal organized groups, and on the re-definition of violence, both in terms of the violent environment in which often the lives of these women unfold, and in terms of their behaviors",organized crime;gender;feminist criminology;gender gap,0.00871800259,0.00326306024,0.00782004558,0.00601533,0.540879667,0.00164871768,0.00168765732,0.0127203614,0.00444420334,0.0266246423,0.00235844241,0.00276757963,0.0015532237,0.00215259101,0.00197700318,0.375369519,
11585/952884,"Youth deviance, urban security and ‘moral panic’:  the case of Italy","American sociological research and prevention policies on youth deviance and juvenile street gangs have a very long tradition. Since the mid-1990s, in some European Countries, youngsters’ antisocial be-haviors in public spaces gained terrain in criminological studies and on the public and political debates. In Italy, instead, youth has not been traditionally meant as a ‘security’ problem, but rather as a matter of educational and social policies. In recent years, however, also in the Italian context urban violence of juvenile street groups has become a recurrent topic in media representation, a source of citizens’ in-security and an issue to be solved by local security policies. Even though from classical approaches street gangs appeared as a complex phenomenon (aggregations involved in criminal acts but, at the same time, types of socialization for youth having a migratory background), there is the tendency to de-scribe street groups according to a unitary and criminalizing ‘gang’ model. The aim of the article is to situate the study of youth street groups within the broader topic of juvenile delinquency in Italy. Moving from how the youth question evolved in Italian debate and policies, socialization practices as well as deviant behaviors of youngster in public spaces are analyzed. The difficulty for young people from the marginal strata to access a structured sociality located in certain urban spaces risks resulting in a subor-dinate social role and, eventually, in violence as a reaction in search of visibility. The ultimate goal of the article is to provide a reinterpretation of street groups that is not oversimplified and that pays attention to processes of inclusion/exclusion within the social structure, urban space, and the related conflict dy-namics.",Juvenile delinquency; Street Gangs; Moral panic; Urban violence; Security policies,0.0764199644,0.00179427,0.0111104297,0.0210871492,0.0548120588,0.00210513524,0.00141536444,0.0203548688,0.00547308056,0.25262779,0.0355971567,0.00301705883,0.00177789072,0.00193614524,0.00248411042,0.507987559,
11585/940490,“Till death do us apart”: The common destiny of brown hare and its parasite community,": Although parasites may threaten individual hosts' survival and reproduction, their role as an essential part of ecosystem functioning and biodiversity has been recognized. In Northern Italy, the hare population has evidently declined since 2008. This paper aims to assess the relationship between host demographic trends and helminth parasite community diversity in a two-year survey in Northern Italy to evaluate the impact of parasites on hosts and confirm the hypothesis that endangered host populations are poor in parasites. In 2013 and 2015 the viscera of 54 and 61 hares legally hunted in agro-ecosystems of the Po Plain were collected. This area is characterized by heavy anthropic pressure: more than 60% of the landscape is represented by agricultural or urbanized territories. No intestinal cestodes were detected. Trichuris sp. and Micipsella numidica were collected in 2015 only; Trichostrongylus retortaeformis, Taenia pisiformis cysticercosis and bronchopulmonary lesions caused by small strongyles were observed in both years. The richness and evenness appeared increased in the second year of the survey, although lower than those obtained by literature data from similar populations examined in the last two decades of 1900. The dominant helminth, T. retortaeformis, was more abundant in individuals with higher weight, while pathological findings were mostly unrelated to this nematode infection; this is consistent with a reduced action, even no harm, of the parasites on the individual host or population level. Our results suggest that the conservation of hosts, environment, and parasites cannot be achieved separately and that parasites and wildlife hosts' destinies are intimately linked, confirming the complexity of ecosystems and the need to contemplate parasite biodiversity in conservation strategies.",Ecology; Histopathology; Lepus europaeus; Parasite biodiversity,0.00489157951,0.0938209519,0.00381145719,0.00194309989,0.00190378877,0.00986854453,0.00185903045,0.00668047369,0.00200309977,0.00240446255,0.0137390085,0.0199918188,0.00472921412,0.00577897672,0.822081923,0.0044924356,

11585/920071,A methodological tool for sustainability and feasibility assessment of indoor vertical farming with artificial lighting in Africa,": African agriculture is bound to face challenges for its future food systems development and economic transformation. Indoor vertical farms with artificial lighting represent an opportunity that has been gaining relevance worldwide, thanks to their potential to enable high productivity rates, food quality and safety, year-round production, and more sustainable use of water and mineral nutrients. The present study assesses the potential for vertical farming technology integration within the African continent, targeting the countries where a more sustainable approach could be achieved.

11585/948620,Are they Twins or Only Friends? The Redundancy and Complementarity of Energy Poverty Indicators in Italy,"A large body of literature has developed numerous unidimensional and multidimensional indicators to identify energy-poor households, also with the aim of targeting public policies. They all have pros and cons and may identify different populations. How do they relate to each other? How should they be used in a country such as Italy where energy poverty has not yet been officially defined? We frame these research questions in a context of general social vulnerability in which several dimensions of poverty intersect. Using SILC data (EU and IT modules) for the period 2004–2015 we compare four widely used unidimensional indicators and provide evidence—for the Italian case—that complementarity among the indicators prevails since the complexity of energy poverty requires a combination of metrics to capture various vulnerabilities. Our results confirm the set of relevant factors affecting the probability of being energy poor which are indicated in the related economics literature, regardless of which indicator is used. They may help tailor policies to tackle the phenomenon. Based on these findings, we strongly support the idea of using a dashboard of different metrics to measure energy poverty to design effective policies.",Energy poverty; Energy poverty indicators; Hidden energy poverty; Energy vulnerability; SDG 7; Italy,0.853943169,0.00534625584,0.00353584555,0.00311740115,0.0067014941,0.00333440653,0.00368116214,0.0231931582,0.00336660212,0.0660980493,0.007866011,0.0024633361,0.00386967836,0.0013664132,0.00382080395,0.00829627551,
11585/846267,Assessing the transformative potential of food banks: The case study of magazzini sociali (Italy),"Food poverty and/or food insecurity have become a substantial problem in the advanced capitalist world, with growing portions of people struggling to eat healthy food every day. At the same time, just in the European Union (EU), around 88 million tonnes of food waste are generated annually. We call this paradox the “food paradox”. The question is, how to tackle food paradox? Food banks are usually presented as a win–win solution to tackle the food paradox, despite being quite controversial. Indeed, food banks are highly contested because, according to critics, they do not aim to address the structural causes, but rather they only intervene on the effects of the food paradox. This paper develops the PAHS conceptual framework, the acronym of prefiguration, autonomy, hybridization, and scalability, which provides the four categories through which to explore the transformative potential of food surplus redistribution initiatives. The PAHS is adopted to investigate the case study of Magazzini Sociali, a food bank project developed by IoPotentino, a not-for-profit organization operating in Potenza. The results show a good transformative potential of the organization and provide an example of social innovation that can be replicated in other contexts.",Food banks; Food donation; Food waste; Transformative potential,0.609282792,0.120518401,0.00511673186,0.00363936299,0.00444199936,0.0145744095,0.00475732842,0.0966448709,0.00891788118,0.0517889969,0.0119207222,0.0286285784,0.00942441169,0.00460826186,0.0164512321,0.0092840353,
11585/968227,Avoiding overestimates of climate risks from population ageing,"Population ageing is expected to lead to significant rises in climate risks because vulnerability rises sharply throughout people’s later years. When assessing the vulnerability of older people, however, what’s important isn’t the number of years someone has lived (i.e. “chronological age”) but rather their functional abilities and characteristics; the latter is better captured by remaining life expectancy or “prospective age”. Here, we show that assessing growth in the size of older populations using a prospective rather than chronological age perspective can help avoid overestimates of future risks to climate change. Compared to an analysis based on chronological age, the projected increase in the vulnerable population share seen in the prospective age analysis is considerably lower. The differences between the two perspectives increase with age, decrease with country income level, and are larger in futures that give priority to sustainable development. Thus, while ageing certainly poses major challenges to societies facing climate change, these may be smaller than thought. Prospective age offers a relatively easily implemented alternative for projecting future vulnerability that better accounts for rising longevity.",population ageing; climate risks; prospective age; chronological age,0.201235056,0.026250992,0.00300103379,0.0133653879,0.00837976951,0.00424923096,0.00571118062,0.389528483,0.015372837,0.0544334203,0.0141073633,0.0204480663,0.206791669,0.00284527242,0.0221473332,0.0121330293,
11585/879154,"Carbon footprint and mitigation strategies among heterogeneous dairy farms in Paraná, Brazil","Dairy production is a vital part of the Brazilian agri-food system, providing food security, employment, and income in rural areas. Nevertheless, rearing dairy cattle leads to greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions which may contribute to global warming and consequently climate change. The remarkable heterogeneity among dairy farms as well as the lack of representative research pose constraints to the development of effective actions to reduce GHG emissions in emerging countries. In this study, we explore a large farm survey to group farms and derive their carbon footprint (CF). Cluster analysis and life cycle assessment are applied to a sample of 911 farms. The results of the analysis categorized the farms into four groups. Statistical comparisons indicated a significant difference in the CF between groups for producing one kg of fat and protein corrected milk (FPCM). The mean CF results ranged from 1.75 kg CO2eq. (kg FPCM)−1 in Group 1 (G1) to 3.27 kg CO2eq. (kg FPCM)−1 in Group 4 (G4). While G1 was composed of larger farms, on average having more access to technologies and technical support, G4 was composed of less specialized producers, owning dual-purpose herds. We also identified and discussed key strategies and management practices that can be adopted by farmers for reducing the CF of dairy farming.

11585/969966,Coabitare il territorio: il turismo responsabile come pratica di ospitalità e cura delle comunità,"The study of tourism is one of the privileged gateways for understanding the territory, not only from an economic point of view. Tourism plays an essential role in the social and spatial dialectic that assigns meaning to places: on the one hand, it feeds the individual and collective imaginary through the production of icons and representations; on the other hand, it shapes places, which become ""touristy"" through visible transformations that spatialize those same images. Since the 1970s, various observers have denounced the tourist phenomenon as a new form of alienation, environmental destruction or imperialism. In the wake of these and other calls for the need to rethink and govern an ever-growing industry, the so-called responsible tourism has emerged as a mode of travel that meets and respects the needs of travelers and host regions while protecting and enhancing the opportunities of specific territories. Starting from a reflection on the dimensions, impacts and changes taking place in one of the phenomena characterizing contemporary times, this article, as well as the special issue it introduces, takes as a case study IT.A.CÀ_migrants and travelers, the first festival at the European level focused explicitly on the theme of responsible tourism. The journey through the different editions of IT.A.CÀ_migrants and travelers allows us to assess assumptions, outcomes and future potential of experiences and practices that in recent years, through participatory processes of sharing, co-designing, dialogue and experimentation, have sought to combine the sustainability of tourism with the well-being of citizens, imagining a valorization of the territory that promotes the transition to a sustainable cohabitation of the Earth.",responsible tourism; sustainability; mobility; participation; hospitality; territory; Italy;,0.0178863164,0.00609556399,0.00217022677,0.0228863955,0.00346001494,0.00664329482,0.0062500895,0.231767,0.061347995,0.013707649,0.0361190028,0.449167162,0.0118058249,0.00502410484,0.0221902635,0.103479125,

The main risk attributed to CTs is represented by Legionella, a Gram-negative bacterium associated with a severe form of pneumonia known as Legionnaires' disease (LD). The infection route is by inhalation of aerosols reaching the lower respiratory tract.  Despite several events associated with CTs, the knowledge in this field is still limited.  The aim of this study was to develop a predictive model of bioaerosol dispersion using PM10 particles as a proxy, to generate risk maps of Legionella spread in the surrounding area in several weather and microbiological conditions.  The Legionella contamination in the CT basin was 40938 ± 24523 cfu/L, with four peaks independent of the season, associated with an increase in air minimum temperature values (+1–2 °C) and a high relative humidity (66–100%) preceded by rainfall (0.2–30.6 mm/day).  The model revealed that the most extensive bioaerosol spread is predicted in winter and summer, with an increase in Legionella risk at a distance of up to 1.5 km from the CT.

We conducted a multicenter international cross-sectional study to evaluate the correlation between alcohol use and driving-related skill as measured by brake reaction time (RT). Methods: Before and after the entrance into randomly selected recreational sites from six European countries, all subjects aged 16-35 years, owning a driver license, were asked to compile a structured socio-demographic questionnaire and measure RT (SimuNomad3 driving simulator), breath alcohol concentration (BAC; Drager Alcoltest), and drug use (Oratect III saliva test, only at the exit). Mixed regression modeling was used to evaluate the independent association between RT and alcohol concentration or drug use. Results: Before the entrance into the recreational site, 4534 subjects completed all assessments and composed the final sample. Their mean age was 23.1 ± 4.2y; 68.3% were males; 54.7% had BAC &gt; 0 g/L (assumed alcoholics); 7.5% declared illegal drug assumption (mostly cannabis). After the exit, 3019 also completed the second assessment: 71.7% showed BAC &gt; 0 g/L. Controlling for age, gender, educational level, occupation, driver license years, and drug use, BAC was positively associated with RT, achieving significance, however, only when BAC was higher than 0.49 g/L. Significant interaction terms were found between BAC and female gender or drug use, with highest RTs (&gt; 1 sec.) recorded among drug users with BAC &gt; = 1 g/L.

The cases researched include examples of urban agriculture, food hubs, buyers’ groups, and specialist retailers. The results indicate that alternative food networks can improve access to healthy food, provide fairer conditions for farmers, reduce food loss/waste, increase environmental protection, and facilitate climate change adaptation.

It takes many forms, from full-time employment to various types of flexible work, which involves short-term, non-standard and informal work. Despite its relevance and complexity, the connection between higher education and concurrent employment has been only partially explored in scholarly debate. This paper investigates the differing patterns of employment for university students, focusing on the role played by parental background, educational choices (i.e., field of study and residential status) and access to benefits. The analyses apply to the Italian higher education system and are based on data collected through a survey carried out among students enrolled at the University of Bologna, which has a highly developed student grant system and a large number of away from home students. Using multinomial logistic regression, the paper shows that students native of Bologna from lower socio-economic backgrounds and enrolled in the humanities and social sciences are more likely than their peers to be in employment.

Methods: We concentrate on patients affected by diabetes mellitus type 2, for which the assumption of responsibility and the adoption of clinical guidelines are specifically rewarded. We test the hypothesis that, other things equal, patients under the responsibility of general practitioners (GPs) receiving a higher share of their income through these programs are less likely to experience hospitalisation for hyperglycaemic emergencies. To this end, we examine the combined influence of physician, organisational and patient factors by means of multilevel modelling for the year 2003. Results: Programs aimed at stimulating GP assumption of responsibility in disease management significantly reduce the probability of hyperglycaemic emergencies for their patients. Conclusions: Although it has been recognised that incentive-based remuneration schemes can have an impact on GP behaviour, there is still weak empirical evidence on the extent to which such programs influence healthcare outcomes.

We validate this technology using in vivo rat models, showing that the cufs form and maintain a self-closing and reliable bioelectronic interface with the sciatic nerve of rats without the use of surgical sutures or glues.

Because industrial compost contains undeteriorated fragments of these bags, application to field soil is a potential source of small-sized residues from these bags. This study was undertaken to examine deterioration of these compostable film microplastics (CFMPs) in field soil at three different localities in Italy. Deterioration of CFMPs did not exceed 5.7% surface area reduction during the 12-month experimental period in two sites located in Northern Italy. More deterioration was observed in the Southern site, with 7.2% surface area reduction. Deterioration was significantly increased when fields were amended with industrial compost (up to 9.6%), but not with home compost.

11585/731500,Food insecurity and major diet-related morbidities in migrating children: A systematic review,"Children of migrant families are known to be at a higher risk of diet-related morbidities due to complex variables including food insecurity, cultural and religious beliefs, and sociodemographic factors like ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and education. Several studies have assessed the presence of specific diseases related to dietary issues in migrant children. This systematic review aims to highlight the existing body of work on nutritional deficiencies in the specific vulnerable pediatric population of immigrants. Refugees were intentionally excluded because of fundamental differences between the two groups including the reasons for migration and health status at the time of arrival. A total of 29 papers were included and assessed for quality. Most of them described a strong correlation between obesity and migration. A high prevalence of stunting, early childhood caries, iron and vitamin D deficiency was also reported, but the studies were few and heterogeneous. Food insecurity and acculturation were found important social factors (nevertheless with inconclusive results) influencing dietary habits and contributing to the development of morbidities such as obesity and other metabolic disorders, which can cause progressive unsustainability of health systems. Public health screening for diet-related diseases in migrant children may be implemented. Educational programs to improve children’s diet and promote healthy-living behaviors as a form of socioeconomic investment for the health of the new generations may also be considered.",Children; Diet; Early childhood caries; Food insecurity; Iron; Migration; Obesity; Stunting; Vitamin D; Vulnerable groups,0.17276217,0.501482129,0.0302260909,0.0143209081,0.0188677087,0.00887650065,0.0022939092,0.0562336519,0.00353227602,0.145168453,0.00459394371,0.0066607506,0.00640647626,0.00724284677,0.0117012858,0.00963092595,
11585/849909,Gender and socioeconomic inequalities in health and wellbeing across age in France and Switzerland,"There is increasing evidence that wellbeing is unequally distributed across sociodemographic groups in contemporary societies. However, less is known about the divergence across social groups of trajectories of wellbeing across age groups. This issue is of great relevance in contexts characterised by changing population structures and growing imbalances across and within generations, and in which ensuring that everyone has the opportunity to have a happy and healthy life course is a primary welfare goal. In this study, we investigate wellbeing trends in France and Switzerland across age, gender, and socioeconomic status groups. We use two household surveys (the Sant´e et Itin´eraires Professionnels and the Swiss Household Panel) to compare the unfolding inequalities in health and wellbeing across age groups in two rich countries. We view wellbeing as multidimensional, following the literature highlighting the importance of considering dierent dimensions and measures of wellbeing. Thus, we investigate a number of outcomes, including dierent measures of physical and mental health, as well as of relational wellbeing, using a linear regression model and a linear probability model. Our findings show interesting country and dimension-specific heterogeneities in the development of health and wellbeing over age. While our results indicate that there are gender and educational inequalities in both Switzerland and France, and that gender inequalities in mental health accumulate with age in both countries, we also find that educational inequalities in health and wellbeing remain rather stable across age groups.",multidimensional wellbeing; sociodemographic inequalities; age development; cross-country comparison,0.615293622,0.00678391056,0.00913437456,0.0171471033,0.14472793,0.00200217846,0.00164986472,0.0332504213,0.00283990148,0.137978151,0.00294505828,0.00160919991,0.00244409498,0.00127113611,0.00194557838,0.0189774763,

We look at how the composition of the pool of active workers changes as the wage rate increases. Contrary to what would expect, average productivity does not necessarily increase monotonically in the wage rate. We identify conditions in which a wage increase reduces the average productivity and/or average vocation of active workers.

11585/84341,INCENTIVES IN PRIMARY CARE AND THEIR IMPACT ON POTENTIALLY AVOIDABLE HOSPITAL ADMISSIONS,"Financial incentives in primary care have been introduced with the purpose of improving appropriateness of care and containing demand. We usually observe pay-for-performance programs, but alternatives have been also implemented, such as pay-for-participation in improvement activities and pay-for-compliance with clinical guidelines. Here, we assess the influence of different programs which ensure extra-payments to GPs for containing avoidable hospitalisations. Our dataset covers patients and GPs of the Italian region Emilia-Romagna for year 2005. By separating pay-for-performance from pay-for-participation and pay-for-compliance programs, we estimate the impact of different financial incentives on the probability of avoidable hospitalisations. As dependent variable, we consider two different sets of conditions, for both of which timely and effective primary care should be able to limit the need of hospital admission. The first is based on 27 medical DRGs that Emilia-Romagna identifies as at risk of inappropriateness in primary care, while the second refers to the internationally recognised ambulatory care-sensitive conditions. We show that pay-for-performance schemes may have a significant effect over aggregate indicators of appropriateness, while the effectiveness of pay-for-participation schemes is adequately captured only by taking into account subpopulations affected by specific diseases. Moreover, the same scheme produces different effects on the two sets of indicators used, with performance improvements limited to the target explicitly addressed by the Italian policy maker. This evidence is consistent with the idea that a “tunnel vision” effect may occur when public authorities monitor specific sets of objectives as proxies for more general improvements in the quality of health care delivered.",PRIMARY CARE; PREVENTABLE HOSPITALISATIONS; FINANCIAL INCENTIVES; ORGANIZATIONAL APPROPRIATENESS; MULTILEVEL MODELLING,0.215318128,0.00302267028,0.0163998976,0.0116821602,0.0103016077,0.00306240562,0.00160213839,0.0284681153,0.00735119591,0.457126409,0.0104611078,0.00591330836,0.00150894874,0.00292205065,0.00411512237,0.220744789,
11585/677917,International Immigration and Female Labour Supply,"One of the key questions on international migration concerns its benefits and costs for the receiving economies. Assessing the overall net gain or loss to the economy from immigration is a challenging task both from a theoretical and an empirical point of view. Immigration can affect the receiving economy through several channels: wages or employment effects on native workers, changes in output structure, fiscal effects, effects on house prices, and so on. In this chapter we concentrate on one of the most important channel: the impact on wage and employment of natives. We consider the impact of immigration on a subgroup of the population that could particularly benefits from it, the female population. Moreover, because international migration may change the prevailing wage rates in the sectors where large number of migrants looks for a job, we focus on immigrants working in the household service sector. The underlying idea is that migrants could increase the availability of services to households, like child-care, housekeeping, or caring of elderly, reducing their market prices. This effect could induce women to change their decision on participation to the labour market. A first focus of the chapter is to answer to some specific questions: does immigration affect female labour market supply? Does it affect full-time and/or part-time jobs? Which native-born women are more affected? In doing that, we discuss more general issues related to the migration phenomenon. For instance, the first problem that arises is how to measure migration intensity and how to measure a change in the decision about participating or not to the labour market. After a brief general discussion we present, in the second section of the chapter, the definition of the variables and the empirical approach we adopt to estimate the relevant impacts on the female labour supply. The results are presented in the third section of the chapter. In the empirical analysis we use data of countries with quite different institutions (Australia, Germany, Switzerland, UK, and the US ). This gives us the opportunity to understand whether the effect of migrants on female labour supply is relevant in countries where policies are more or less supportive to families. These policy-related results are discussed in a separate section.

Territories that are economically weak and extremely poor in terms of natural resources have been shaken by severe flood events that caused the loss of thousands of human lives, displacement of people and damage to the environment. On May 24th 2004, the flooding of the trans-boundary river Soliette killed over 1000 Haitian and Dominican people, wiping out villages and leaving behind desolation and poverty. After this catastrophic flood event, the General Direction for Development and Cooperation of the Italian Department of Foreign Affairs funded through the Istituto Italo-Latino Americano (IILA, www.iila.org) an international cooperation initiative (ICI), coordinated and directed by the University of Bologna. The ICI involved Haitian and Dominican institutions and was twofold: (a) institutional capacity building on flood risk management and mitigation measures and policies; (b) hydrological and hydraulic analysis of the May 2004 flood event aimed at formulating a suitable and affordable flood risk mitigation plan, consisting of structural and non-structural measures.",INSTITUTIONAL CAPACITY BUILDING; FLOOD RISK MITIGATION PLAN; RIVER SOLIETTE; HAITI; DOMINICAN REPUBLIC,0.738117158,0.00932198483,0.00699908054,0.0045223129,0.00533658173,0.0241606776,0.00278078066,0.034054134,0.00536461361,0.0783556774,0.0449038669,0.00324163795,0.0063781254,0.00403640606,0.00897663739,0.0234503467,

To this end, we carry out an overview of pilgrimage routes policies and governance frameworks in Europe and then focus on a specific case study: The Emilia-Romagna region in Italy with the three main faith-led routes traversing the region towards Rome: Via Francigena, Romea Germanica and Romea Strata.   The chapter concludes that collaboration among the three key players should be strengthen since they have complementary objectives to fulfil through pilgrimage.

We have recently characterized the molecular nature of the IF1–Oligomycin Sensitivity Conferring Protein (OSCP) subunit interaction; however, it remains to be determined whether this interaction could be targeted for novel anti-cancer therapeutic intervention. We generated mitochondria-targeting peptides to displace IF1 from the OSCP interaction. The use of one selective peptide led to displacement of the inhibitor IF1 from ATP synthase, as shown by immunoprecipitation. NMR spectroscopy analysis, aimed at clarifying whether these peptides were able to directly bind to the OSCP protein, identified a second peptide which showed affinity for the N-terminal region of this subunit overlapping the IF1 binding region. In situ treatment with the membrane-permeable derivatives of these peptides in HeLa cells, that are silenced for the IF1 inhibitor protein, showed significant inhibition in mitochondrial permeability transition and no effects on mitochondrial respiration. These peptides mimic the effects of the IF1 inhibitor protein in cancer HeLa cells and confirm that the IF1–OSCP interaction inhibits apoptosis. A third peptide was identified which counteracts the anti-apoptotic role of IF1, showing that OSCP is a promising target for anti-cancer therapies.",cancer; mitochondria; therapy; ATP synthase; permeability transition pore; inhibitor;protein IF1,0.00219179853,0.00293777091,0.952650607,0.00229611876,0.00524072303,0.00138891221,0.00178658182,0.00119855616,0.00207980396,0.0184652265,0.00289911358,0.000757225789,0.000857203151,0.0019632,0.00101827586,0.00226892903,

11585/938554,"Psychosocial predictors of postnatal anxiety and depression: Using Structural Equation Modelling to investigate the relationship between pressure to breastfeed, healthcare professional support, postnatal guilt and shame, and postnatal anxiety and depression within an infant feeding context","In high income settings, high perceived pressure to breastfeed and poor perceived quality of healthcare professional support have been associated with early breastfeeding cessation, guilt, and shame. This is important because guilt and shame significantly predict postnatal anxiety and depression. No previous attempts have been made to provide quantitative evidence for relationships mapped between the postnatal social context, infant feeding method, and emotional wellbeing outcomes. The current study aimed to empirically investigate aforementioned pathways. Structural equation modelling was applied to survey data provided online by 876 mothers. Guilt and shame both significantly predicted anxiety and depression. Poor healthcare professional support and high pressure to breastfeed increased anxiety and depression, and these effects were explained by indirect pathways through increases in guilt and shame. Formula feeding exclusivity was negatively correlated with postnatal anxiety symptoms. This finding may be explained by feelings of relief associated with observed infant weight gain and being able to share infant feeding responsibilities with others e.g., one’s partner. This relationship, however, was counterbalanced by an indirect pathway where greater formula feeding exclusivity positively predicted guilt, which in turn increased postnatal anxiety score. While guilt acted as mediator of infant feeding method to increase postnatal depression and anxiety, shame acted independently of infant feeding method. These identified differences provide empirical support for the transferability of general definitions of guilt (i.e., as remorse for having committed a moral transgression) and shame (i.e., internalisation of transgressive remorse to the self), to an infant feeding context.

11585/966394,Religious affiliation and child mortality in Ireland: A country-wide analysis based on the 1911 Census,"Background: Previous studies have identified a link between religious affiliation and child mortality, yet the underlying factors that contributed to this association are not fully understood.  Objective: This study investigates how religious affiliation impacted child mortality in early 20th century Ireland, controlling for socioeconomic status, literacy, and place of residence at both the individual and contextual level.  Methods: We utilize the 1911 IPUMS Irish census, indirect techniques, and regression analysis to examine the role of religious affiliation in child mortality. We therefore perform various OLS regressions, controlling for demographic factors and socioeconomic conditions at both the individual and contextual level, as well as for the three major religious groups.  Results: Our results indicate striking differences in child mortality rates among the three major religious denominations in Ireland in the early 20th century. Catholics recorded the highest child mortality rates, followed by Church of Ireland families, while Presbyterians experienced the best child mortality outcomes. These differences are explained in part by the varying socioeconomic characteristics of each religious group, but religious affiliation is also shown to have mattered. For reasons that are not altogether clear, Jewish communities had lower child mortality rates than the major religious denominations.  Conclusions: Our study highlights the complex interplay between religious affiliation, socioeconomic factors, and child mortality in Ireland in the early 1900s. Our findings reveal a significant association between religious affiliation and child mortality, which persists even after controlling for certain individual socioeconomic characteristics and contextual factors.

11585/126326,Socio-economic factors associated with infant mortality in Italy: an ecological study.,"Abstract Introduction: One issue that continues to attract the attention of public health researchers is the possible relationship in high-income countries between income, income inequality and infant mortality (IM). The aim of this study was to assess the associations between IM and major socio-economic determinants in Italy. Methods: Associations between infant mortality rates in the 20 Italian regions (2006–2008) and the Gini index of income inequality, mean household income, percentage of women with at least 8 years of education, and percentage of unemployed aged 15–64 years were assessed using Pearson correlation coefficients. Univariate linear regression and multiple stepwise linear regression analyses were performed to determine the magnitude and direction of the effect of the four socio-economic variables on IM. Results: The Gini index and the total unemployment rate showed a positive strong correlation with IM (r = 0.70; p < 0.001 and r = 0.84; p < 0.001 respectively), mean household income showed a strong negative correlation (r =−0.78; p < 0.001), while female educational attainment presented a weak negative correlation (r =−0.45; p < 0.05). Using a multiple stepwise linear regression model, only unemployment rate was independently associated with IM (b= 0.15, p < 0.001). Conclusions: In Italy, a high-income country where health care is universally available, variations in IM were strongly associated with relative and absolute income and unemployment rate. These results suggest that in Italy IM is not only related to income distribution, as demonstrated for other developed countries, but also to economic factors such as absolute income and unemployment. In order to reduce IM and the existing inequalities, the challenge for Italian decision makers is to promote economic growth and enhance employment levels.

For the classical autoregressive conditional duration (ACD) models by Engle and Russell (1998), we show that the large sample behavior of likelihood estimators is highly sensitive to the tail behavior of the financial durations. In particular, even under stationarity, asymptotic normality breaks down for tail indices smaller than one or, equivalently, when the clustering behavior of the observed events is such that the unconditional distribution of the durations has no finite mean. Instead, we find that estimators are mixed Gaussian and have non-standard rates of convergence.

11585/951446,The future of organic certification: Potential impacts of the inclusion of Participatory Guarantee Systems in the European organic regulation,"Third-party certification (TPC) is the standard approach to quality assurance for organic production, but its administrative burden and cost make it difficult for smallholders to access it. Internal Control Systems (ICS) and Participatory Guarantee Systems (PGS) are possible alternative approaches because they are more accessible and less costly. Regulation (EU) 2018/848 on organic production allows ICS for small farmers. However, PGS are not included, despite being promoted by the International Federation of Organic Agriculture Movements (IFOAM) and officially recognised by several countries worldwide. This study aims to evaluate the possible future inclusion of PGS at the European level. Twenty-eight experts participated in a Delphi exercise, and both optimistic and pessimistic views were agreed upon amongst them. In the pessimistic view, bureaucratic excess and standardisation requirements needed in the process of PGS institutionalisation could emerge, resulting in even more rigid practices compared to the current ones. In the optimistic view, recognising PGS as a legitimate approach to guarantee the quality of organic products could foster the inclusion of smallholders by lowering certification costs, increasing cohesion and competencies amongst rural development actors and increasing the reputation of PGS-certified local products.",Delphi method; European Union; Group certification; Organic certification; Organic regulation; Participatory Guarantee Systems (PGS),0.0296103582,0.236898854,0.0071440856,0.0224964619,0.0379324555,0.0140975881,0.0042132521,0.0489717424,0.00933407526,0.0225823019,0.00400229916,0.0439763032,0.00538972579,0.00464509521,0.0334659368,0.475239486,
11585/802992,The impact of food price shocks on poverty and vulnerability of urban households in Iran,"The aim of this paper is to assess the welfare effects of food price changes on urban households' poverty and vulnerability. This is achieved by using Hicksian price Compensating Variation (CV) and compensated price elasticities, based on Quadratic Almost Ideal Demand System (QAIDS). The study includes in total eight food groups (cereals, meats, dairy, cooking oil, sugar, fruits, vegetables, and tea and coffee) and encompasses 18852 urban households. The results showed that the welfare index for food groups was 20 USD (2.52% of the monthly average income of urban households). After increasing food prices, based on the poverty line, 41% of urban households were observed to be below the poverty line and the number of poor households increased by 10.63%. To enable food security and to execute food safety goals, the Iranian government should compensate for the welfare losses by supportive policies such as direct subsidy payments to vulnerable households.",Compensating Variation (CV); Quadratic Almost Ideal Demand System (QAIDS); welfare effect; vulnerability; food price shocks,0.732273817,0.0901094303,0.0102181751,0.00373402261,0.00842099916,0.0169014931,0.00357265188,0.0298801027,0.00347371376,0.0518615507,0.0112138204,0.00750134373,0.00577047,0.00428159442,0.0106930546,0.0100938492,
11585/961452,The role of the left to the path to a minimum income policy in Italy,"In 2018, Italy became the last of the E.U. member states to introduce a minimum income policy. Our work helps explain why Italy was a laggard in this field by investigating the role the Italian left played, historically, in the evolution of policies to combat poverty. This is a surprisingly neglected topic. We argue that until the fall of the Berlin Wall, the Italian left focused on labour-market insiders – that is, full-time core workers – and appeared largely unconcerned about the most vulnerable individuals, the outsiders, thus accepting the lack of policies to combat poverty. The policy status quo, however, dovetailed with a lively debate among left-wing intellectuals and politicians. This debate paved the way for several attempts by left-wing governments in the 1990s to implement a national pilot scheme (called the Reddito Minimo di Inserimento [R.M.I.]) along with local minimum income policies. The electoral success in 2013 of a new populist movement, the Five-star Movement (M.5.s.), campaigning on the flagship project of the Reddito di Cittadinanza (R.d.C.), fuelled the political debate on anti-poverty policies. This electoral ‘threat’ finally convinced the centre-left government under Paolo Gentiloni to establish in 2018 the Reddito di Inclusione, the first minimum income scheme in Italy. Our work demonstrates the importance of political variables, such as the structure and dynamics of party competition, in the fight against poverty. It also highlights the role of the Italian left as a political innovator in this field.",Italian left; minimum income policy; Partito Democratico (P.D.); party competition,0.842956722,0.00386344478,0.00225342321,0.00305943983,0.00903119,0.00173663208,0.00115587807,0.0344587341,0.00290737255,0.0713462308,0.00451386627,0.00177565054,0.00178768463,0.000770197134,0.00212272839,0.0162608512,
11585/299131,Trend of microbiologically-confirmed tuberculosis in a low-incidence setting with high immigration rates,"BACKGROUND: The metropolitan area of Bologna, a city in Northern Italy (Emilia Romagna region), is considered a low incidence setting for TB, but has a high rate of foreign immigration (13.5% official resident immigrants relative to the whole population in 2011). The aim of this study was to describe the epidemiological trend of TB, focusing on differences between Italian and foreign-born cases. METHODS: We examined all bacteriologically confirmed TB cases identified in the Microbiology Unit of Bologna University Hospital from January 2008 and December 2011. We compared demographic, clinical and microbiological data for Italian vs. foreign-born TB cases. RESULTS: Out of 255 TB cases identified during the study period, 168 (65.9%) were represented by foreign-born cases. The proportion of immigrants with TB progressively increased over the study period (from 60.8% in 2008 to 67.5% in 2011). Although foreign-born cases were significantly younger than Italian cases (mean age 32.3±14.4 years vs 61.9±21.5 years), the mean age among the latter decreased from 71.2 in 2008 to 54.6 years in 2011 (p=0.036).Concerning TB localization, 65.9% (n=168) had pulmonary TB (P-TB) and 34.1% (n=87) extra-pulmonary TB (EP-TB). In this study, 35.6% of Italian-born P-TB cases were smear positive, versus 51.4% of foreign-born P-TB cases. The highest proportion of high-grade positive microscopy P-TB was among subjects between 25-34 years old (36.9%; p=0.004).Mono-resistance to isoniazid (mono-H) was found among 9.2% and 10.1% of Italian and foreign-born cases, respectively. Among Italian cases, resistance to H and any other first line drug (poly-H) and Multidrug resistant TB (MDR-TB) were 4.6% and 1.2%, respectively. In foreign-born cases poly-H (12.8%) and MDR-TB (6.9%) significantly increased over the time (p=0.003 and p=0.007, respectively). The proportion of MDR-TB was significantly higher among immigrants from Eastern Europe (10.9%) compared to Italian-born patients (p=0.043). All (n=9) MTB strains resistant to four or five first line drugs and Extensively drug resistant (XDR-TB) strains were from foreign-born cases. CONCLUSIONS: TB epidemiology in a low incidence setting is strongly influenced by immigration rates. Ethnicity, mean age, and incidence of MDR-TB among foreign-born cases reflect immigration trends in Northern Italy.",tuberculosis; EPIDEMIOLOGY,0.027214,0.00277788728,0.0580560975,0.00955187622,0.0146807367,0.00234920671,0.00276738056,0.017692,0.0066577578,0.795474052,0.0323138572,0.00151804253,0.00388614065,0.00834409613,0.0044036326,0.0123132542,
11585/968441,Unraveling the Mysteries of the Oblique Retinacular Ligament: a Review of its Anatomy and Biomechanical Characteristics,"Introduction  The oblique retinacular ligament (ORL) has fascinated researchers since its first detailed description by Landsmeer in 1949. Integral to the sophisticated mechanics of finger movements, its anatomical presence and function have sparked extensive debate. Despite initial doubts about its existence, it is now recognized as a crucial structure within the hand's biomechanical system. Materials and Methods  A review was conducted to collate primary studies on the ORL, focusing on cadaveric anatomy and biomechanical analyses. Modern dissection techniques and equipment have facilitated the identification of the ORL in virtually all examined samples, moving past earlier challenges of isolating such minute structures. Results  Research elucidates the ORL's dynamic role in coordinating movements between the proximal and distal interphalangeal joints, contradicting earlier theories that deemed it a mere static stabilizer. Recent findings, especially those by Balakrishnan et al., highlight a complex cross structure that allows the ORL to maintain its functional relevance across various joint positions. This challenges previous notions and underscores its significance in finger extension mechanisms. Conclusion  The journey to understand the ORL underscores its pivotal role in hand biomechanics, transforming from a structure of ambiguous existence to a key element in finger movement coordination. This shift in understanding opens new possibilities for therapeutic approaches to hand deformities, emphasizing the ORL's critical function in both anatomical and clinical contexts. As research progresses, it continues to reveal the ORL's complex contributions to hand dynamics, offering insights that promise to enhance outcomes in hand surgery and rehabilitation.",Oblique Retinacular Ligament;Hand Biomechanics;Finger Movement;Anatomy;Anatomical Discovery,0.00503094634,0.00591156585,0.869868815,0.0146892443,0.00700389454,0.00318798772,0.00535149127,0.00343702,0.0164443478,0.0355086736,0.00847622,0.00352271856,0.000910376199,0.00318991113,0.00326075451,0.014206076,
11585/905693,Wellbeing of outdoor education teachers : the role of school management and organization = El bienestar de los profesores de educación al aire libre : el papel de la gestión y la organización escolar,"The following research begins with an increase in the perception of malaise within schools, as evidenced by increased cases of work-related stress and burnout syndrome among teachers. The Covid-19 pandemic and restriction measures reduced people's interactions with their natural environments, making the needs of nature even more urgent than before. The 2030 Agenda objectives point to the need to reduce this gap, especially in relation to the Sustainable Development Goals (UNESCO, 2017). The scientific literature attributes great potential to natural environments in terms of well-being and learning. Therefore, it is fundamental that schools pay more attention to well-being (physical, mental, emotional, social) to counteract the frenzy of teaching-learning rhythms, the static nature of educational proposals, and the social immobility to which children and adults have been exposed during lockdown periods. With this in mind, we chose to investigate the association between Outdoor Education experience, perception of school climate and organization, and teachers' levels of stress, anxiety, and psychophysical fatigue. The following instruments were used: Depression Anxiety Stress Scales - DASS 21 (Lovibond &amp; Lovibond, 1995); Positivity - P-scale (Caprara et al., 2012); Need for Recovery - NFR (Van Veldhoven &amp; Meijman, 1994) and, for school context assessment, the Revised School Level Environment Questionnaire (Matteucci, Guglielmi &amp; Lauermann, 2017). A convenience sample of 123 Italian teachers aged between 24 and 63, 96% of whom were females answered to the anonymous survey. The sample was composed of two different study groups: 74 outdoor teachers and 49 indoor teachers. The data analysis would seem to exclude the direct effect of Outdoor Education on the perception of stress, anxiety, depression, and work-related fatigue. On the other hand, the importance of school climate and organizational characteristics emerges. The practice of OE is statistically significantly associated with better levels of psychophysical well-being of teachers when their school is characterized by sharing responsibilities, cohesion, openness to innovation, and availability of resources.",Outdoor education; wellbeing; school management; relational climate; teachers; work-related fatigue,0.00972713903,0.00490009086,0.00311668823,0.697871149,0.00638051843,0.00203614542,0.00293501886,0.146277279,0.0280704591,0.0142607372,0.00654868176,0.0453907102,0.00737001421,0.00161515281,0.00635138107,0.0171488393,
11585/712202,What Is Social Inequality and Why Does it Matter? Evidence from Central and Eastern Europe,"As distinct from income or wealth inequality, 'social inequality' is currently poorly understood and, at best, unevenly measured. We conceptualize social inequality as the relative position of individuals along a number of dimensions that measure achieved outcomes and, innovatively, expectations about future outcomes. Using data from 12 Central and Eastern European countries, we find that cross-national patterns of social inequality differ significantly from patterns derived from income inequality measures. Moreover, our measure of social inequality is much better correlated than income inequality with other country differences such as higher levels of economic performance and human development, and stronger political institutions.
